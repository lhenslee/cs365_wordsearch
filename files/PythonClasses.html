<li> Overview: Python classes are a cross between C++ classes and Modula 3
  classes. Classes are themselves objects and support multiple inheritance.
<p>
<li> Class declaration
  <ol>
    <li> Syntax
<pre>
class classname:
   variable initializations
   fct definitions
</pre>
    <li> Example
<pre>
class Point:
   x = 0
   y = 0
   def addPoint(self, p1):
      newpoint = Point()
      newpoint.x = self.x + p1.x
      newpoint.y = self.y + p1.y
      return newpoint
</pre>
    <li> Classes are objects so you may dynamically add and delete both
      attributes and functions
      <p>
	<ol>
      	  <li> You can declare a function outside a class and then
	    assign it to the class. It will become a method for all
	    instances, including existing instances. This is a good way to fix a
	    function without having to shutdown the Python interpreter.
          <li> Each class and each instance has a dictionary variable called
	    <tt>__dict__</tt> that stores all instance variables and function
	    definitions
          <li> <tt>del Point.x</tt>: deletes <tt>x</tt> from Point
        </ol>
    <p>
    <li> Instance variables (called attributes or properties in Python)
      <p>
	<ol>
	  <li> Values of instance variables are inherited by instances, but may be overridden:
	    Python first looks in the instance's <tt>__dict__</tt> dictionary
	    and if it does not find the attribute, then it looks in the
	    class's <tt>__dict__</tt> dictionary
	  <li> Referenced using the dot (.) operator
	  <li> All attributes are public. A convention for implying that
	    an attribute is private is to put a _ before it. For example:
<pre>
class Stack:
  _top = 0
</pre>
	  <li> Variables with primitive types are instance variables, but
	    variables with mutable types, such as lists or dictionaries, act
	    like class variables if you modify the value, as opposed to 
	    replacing the value. For example:
<pre>
>>> class Dog:
...    tricks = []
...    def addTrick(self, trick):
...       self.tricks.append(trick)
... 
>>> smiley = Dog()
>>> ebber = Dog()
>>> smiley.addTrick("beg")
>>> ebber.addTrick("fetch")
>>> print smiley.tricks
['beg', 'fetch']
>>> print ebber.tricks
['beg', 'fetch']
</pre>
         If we replace the value, then the attribute becomes a local
         attribute
<pre>
>>> smiley.tricks = ['beg']
>>> smiley.tricks
['beg']
>>> ebber.tricks
['beg', 'fetch']
</pre>
         See <a href="#constructors">constructors</a> for a technique that
         allows you to create local attributes with mutable values.
        </ol>
        <p>
        <li> Methods
	  <p>
	    <ol>
	      <li> Pointer to an instance is automatically passed to a method
		but this pointer must be explicitly declared as the first
		parameter to the method. By convention, Python programmers
		declare this variable as <i>self</i>
              <p>
	      <li> When a function is defined in a class declaration, it
		becomes a function in the resulting class object, but a method in
		any instances. 
		<ol>
		  <li> Subtle but important difference between
		    a function and a method. 
		    <p>
		      <ol>
			<li> The programmer must explicitly pass an instance
			  object to a function 
			<li> A pointer to an instance is implicitly passed as the
			  first argument to a method.
			<li> The following two calls are essentially identical, and
			  Python essentially translates the second call into the
			  first call:
<pre>
a = Point()
b = Point()
c = Point.addPoint(a, b)     // function call
c = a.addPoint(b)            // method call
</pre>
                      </ol>
		   <p>
		   </ol>
	      </ol>
              <p>
		<li id='constructors'> Constructors: The __init__ function
		  (two underscores before and after init)  is the constructor
		  for a class
		  <p>
		    <ol>
		      <li> Only one __init__ function is allowed
		      <li> Attributes that store mutable values should be
			initialized in the constructor:
<pre>
class Stack:
  def __init__(self):
    self.top = 0
    self.data = []
</pre>
                    </ol>
               </ol>
<p>
<li> Inheritance
  <p>
    <ol> 
      <li> Syntax
<pre>
class DerivedClassName(BaseClassName):
    <statement-1>
    .
    .
    .
    <statement-N>
</pre>
      For example:
<pre>
class LabradorRetriever(Dog):
    hair = 'short'
    personality = ['friendly', 'good with children', 'love to fetch']
</pre>
     <li> All methods are virtual, so a subclass can always override its
       base class's methods
       <ol>
	 <li> Can call base class method using
	   <tt>BaseClassName.methodname(self, arguments)</tt>: Note
	   that because you are referencing the base class object, you
	   must pass the self argument explicitly, since you are
	   actually calling a function, not a method
       </ol>
     <p>
     <li> Multiple Inheritance
       <p>
	 <ol>
	   <li> Syntax
<pre>
class DerivedClassName(Base1, Base2, Base3):
    <statement-1>
    .
    .
    .
    <statement-N>
</pre>
           <li> Resolving attribute names and method names
	     <p>
	       <ol>
		 <li> Old-style classes: depth-first, left-to-right through
		   the base classes (i.e., first the inheritance hierarchy
		   for Base1 is searched, then Base2, and so on until the
		   name is resolved)
		   <p>
		     <ol> 
		       <li> old-style classes are created by default and are
		       the ones we will use in this course, since we are
			 using the Python 2.7 interpreter
		       <li> old-style classes were abolished in Python 3,
			 but classes defined in the old way will still 
			 appear to behave like old-style classes
		     </ol>
		     <p>
		 <li> New-style classes: new-style classes have at least
		   one diamond relationship because all new-style classes
		   inherit from <tt>object</tt>. To keep the base classes from being accessed more than once, a dynamic algorithm linearizes the search order in a way that preserves the left-to-right ordering specified in each class, that calls each parent only once, and that is monotonic (meaning that a class can be subclassed without affecting the precedence order of its parents). 
		   <p>
                    <ol>
	              <li> New-style classes were introduced in Python 2.2
		      <li> New-style classes are the only class available 
			after Python 3, but they are still not part of the
			standard Python documentation, so their integration
			into the language is currently rather poor.
