<h2>Python Modules and Packages</h2>
</center>
<p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li> Overview: Python's module and package mechanism resembles Java's
  package mechanism. 
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li> A module is a python file that ends with <tt>.py</tt>
      <li> A package is a directory with a collection of modules or subpackages.
	<p>
	  <ol>
	    <li> The name of the package is the name of the directory. 
	  </ol>
      <li> One uses the <tt>import</tt> statement to import a module or
	package. For example:
<pre>
import sys           # import the system defined sys module--you can use the
                     #   functions in sys as long as you prefix them with sys.
import foo           # import foo.py. You can use the functions in foo as long as
                     #   you prefix them with foo.
from foo import min  # import the min function from foo into the current namespace.
                     #   You can use min without qualification
from foo import *    # import all functions from foo into the current namespace.
                     #   You can use all functions in foo without qualification
import sounds.effects.echo  # import echo.py from the sounds.effects package
                            # You can use the functions in echo as long as
                            # you prefix them with the full package name
                            # sounds.effects.echo.
from sounds.effects import echo     # You can use the functions in echo as
                                    # long as you prefix them with echo (you no
                                    # longer need the fully qualified package name)

from sounds.effects import *        # assume that effects is a directory. this
                                    # command does not work like you expect. See the
                                    # <a href="#packages">packages</a> section below for details
</pre>
      </ol>
<p>
<li> Modules
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li> When python imports a module, it compiles the file into byte codes
	and stores the byte codes in a .pyc file. 
	<p>
	  <ol>
	    <li> This .pyc file does not speed up the execution of a program
	      because the Python interpreter always interprets byte codes
            <li> The .pyc file speeds up subsequent imports of the module
	      because the compiler does not need to be invoked a second time
          </ol>
      <li> The module search path: Python first searchs for built-in modules
	and then for modules in directories on the <tt>sys.path</tt> list
	<p>
	  <ol> 
	    <li> By default, the current directory is the first entry on the
	    sys.path list
	    <li> The remaining entries are Python libraries defined by the
	      system-dependent default implementation
            <li> You can add new directories either to the beginning or end
	      of the list using standard list operations: If you add the
	      directories to the beginning of the list, you will mask the 
	      modules in the Python libraries if the new directories contain
	      similarly named modules.
          </ol>
       <li> The <b>dir</b> command
	 <ol>
	   <li> dir(module_name): Returns a list of names in the specified
	     module
	   <li> dir(): Returns a list of names in the current
	     namespace
         </ol>
       </ol>
<p>
<a name="packages" /a>
<li> Packages
  <p>
    <ol> 
      <li> __init__.py: Every package directory must have an <tt>__init__.py</tt>
      file, even if the file is empty (actually no longer true since Python 3.3,
      but we are using Python 2.7). This file tells Python to treat the
      directory as a package (otherwise Python treats the directory as an
      unnamed collection of modules).
      <p>
      <li> Importing * from a package: To force Python to import all modules
	in a package, you must add the module names to the __all__ list in
	__init__.py. For example, suppose your package structure is:
<pre>
silhouette/
  __init__.py
  graphics/
     __init__.py
     rect.py
     circle.py
  events/
     __init__.py
     mouse.py
     keyboard.py
</pre>
       If you want the command
<pre>
from silhouette.events import *
</pre>
       to import <tt>mouse.py</tt> and <tt>keyboard.py</tt>, then the
       __init__.py file for events should be:
<pre>
__all__ = ["mouse", "keyboard"]
</pre>
       Even after importing mouse and keyboard, you will still have to
       access their functions by qualifying them with either mouse or
       keyboard.
</ol>
