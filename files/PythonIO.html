<ol>
<li> Console I/O: I generally don't recommend trying to get input from stdin
  using Python, but if you insist, read on.
  <p>
  <ol>
  <li> Pre-Python 3: Use <tt>raw_input(prompt)</tt> to get input
<pre>
x = raw_input("Enter value: ")
</pre>
       The input comes in as a string and you need to convert it to
       the appropriate representation using a cast. For example, to
       convert <tt>x</tt> to an int, you would use <tt>int(x)</tt>.
  <li> Python 3 and later: Use <tt>input(prompt)</tt> to get input
    <ol>
      <li> <tt>input(prompt)</tt> was defined before Python 3 but it
	evaluated a string as though it were a python expression
    </ol>
  <li> These commands expect input. If you type Ctrl-D to send the
    EOF character, you will get an exception, not normal termination.
  <li> To read from <tt>stdin</tt> without prompting, use <tt>sys.stdin</tt>
    and treat input like a list:
<pre>
import sys    # sys is not pre-defined
for line in sys.stdin:
   process the line of input
</pre>
   <li> To break a line of input into fields, use the
     <a href="PythonVarsControlStructs.html#stringsplit">str.split()</a> method.
     Use
     <tt>str.strip</tt> to strip away leading and trailing whitespace, including
     the newline character.
   </ol>
<p>
<li> String Formatting for Output: Use <tt>print</tt> to print a string. This section tells you how
      to create a formatted string for printing

  <ol>
    <li> String alignment: For simple alignment, you can use the following
      commands.
      <ol>
	<li> Alignment commands
      <ol>
	<li> str.ljust(width): left justifies the string in a field of
	  the specified width
	<li> str.rjust(width): right justifies the string in a field of
	  the specified width
	<li> str.center(width): centers the string in a field of the
	  specified width
        <li> str.zfill(width): left justifies the string in a field of
	  the specified width and fills blanks with 0's
      </ol>
	<li> General 
	  <ol>
	    <li> all justification commands return a new string rather
	      than modifying the original string
	    <li> if the string is too big too fit in the specified justification
	      field, then the original string is returned--no truncation is
	      performed and no justification is performed
          </ol>
    </ol>
   <li id='format'> Formatting a String for Output: The <tt>format()</tt> method can
     be used like C's printf method to format strings. 
     <ol>
       <li> <tt>formatstr.format(arg<sub>1</sub>, arg<sub>2</sub>, ... arg<sub>n</sub>)</tt>: returns a formatted string with arg<sub>1</sub>, arg<sub>2</sub>, ... arg<sub>n</sub>
	 substituted into <tt>formatstr</tt>. The
	 original string is not modified.
       <li> Examples:
<pre>
>>> x = 10
>>> y = 'brad'
>>> 'x = {0:8d} and y = {1:20s}--correct?'.format(x,y)
'x =       10 and y = brad                --correct?'
>>> 'x = {0:<8d} and y = {1:^20s}--correct?'.format(x,y)
'x = 10       and y =         brad        --correct?'
</pre>
        <li> Syntax
	  <ol>
	    <li> {}'s specify where the arguments should be placed in the string
	       <ol>
		 <li> You may omit the numbers in curly braces, in which
		   case the default numbering is 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
		 <li> {0.weight}: Accesses the weight property of the 0th
		   argument
		 <li> {0[i]}: Accesses the element at index <tt>i</tt> in
		   a sequence
<pre>
>>> x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> 'x[1] = {0[1]}'.format(x)
'x[1] = 2'
</pre>
		 <li> {player}: Accesses a keyword argument named player:
<pre>
>>> x = 10
>>> 'x = {player}'.format(player=x)
'x = 10'
</pre>
                 <li> For readability put keyword arguments after positional
		   arguments
		 </ol>
             <li> Format specifiers: Looks much like C's printf except for
	       alignment specifiers
	       <ol>
		 <li> Syntax: {0:formatSpecifiers}
		 <li> Abbreviated syntax for format specifiers: Everything in []'s is optional. For
		   full syntax see the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#formatspec">Formatting Mini-Language</a>.
<pre>
[[fill]align][width][.precision][type]
</pre>		      
                 <li> fill: any fill character
		 <li> align: by default numbers are right aligned and
		   strings are left aligned
		   <table>
		     <tr><th>Option</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
		     <tr><td> &lt; </td><td>left align</td></tr>
		     <tr><td> &gt; </td><td>right align</td></tr>
		     <tr><td> ^ </td><td>center</td></tr>
		   </table>
		 <li> width: field width
		 <li> precision: number of digits after decimal point
		 <li> type: type of the argument--same types as for printf

<p>
<li> File I/O
  <ol>
    <li> opening and closing files
      <ol>
	<li> <tt>open(filename, mode)</tt> opens a file and returns a reference
	  to a file object.
	  <ol>
	    <li> mode can be 'r' for read, 'w' for write, and 'a' for append
	    <li> mode can be omitted in which case it defaults to read
          </ol>
        <li> <tt>f.close()</tt>: closes the file object
	<li> Since you often forget to close files, or exceptions may occur
	  and the file does not get closed, it is good to get into the habit
	  of opening files with <tt>with</tt>
<pre>
>>> with open('workfile', 'r') as f:
...     read_data = f.read()
</pre>
          When <tt>with</tt> exits for any reason, the file is automatically
          closed.
      </ol>
    <li> reading from files
      <ol>
	<li> <tt>f.read()</tt>: reads the entire file into a string
        <li> <tt>f.readline()</tt>: reads the next line in the file
	  <ol>
	    <li> the string will include the newline character. Use 
	      the string's <tt>strip</tt> method to strip the newline
	      character.
	    <li> <tt>readline()</tt> returns the empty string ('') 
	      when EOF is reached. If
	      a line is blank, but not EOF, then readline returns "\n".
	  </ol>
        <li> You can treat a file like a list:
<pre>
for line in f:
   ... process line ...
</pre>
        <li> <tt>f.readlines()</tt>: returns a list of the lines in a file
	  (each line will have the newline character appended)
	<li> To break a line of input into fields, use the
     <a href="python1.html#stringsplit">str.split()</a> method. Use
     <tt>str.strip</tt> to strip away leading and trailing whitespace, including
     the newline character.
        </ol>
    <p>
    <li> writing to files
      <ol>
	<li> f.write(string): writes a string to a file
	<li> To write anything other than a string to a file, you must
	  convert it to a string using <tt>str()</tt>:
<pre>
f.write(str(20))
</pre>
        <li> 
Serialization/deserialization: <i>Serialization</i>
		refers to the conversion of a complex object to a string
		representation that can be written to a file.
		<i>Deserialization</i> refers to the conversion of this
		string representation back to an object when the string
		is read from the file.
		<ol>
		  <li> Two techniques in Python to serialize objects
		    <ol>
		      <li> Json to write lists, dictionaries, sequences, and
			primitive types to files (but not classes!)
			<p>
			  <ol>
			    <li> JSON is a standard used for data exchange among 
		applications
			    <li> Python has a <tt>json</tt> module that allows objects
		to be dumped to a file and then re-loaded
			    <li> json module commands
			      <ol>
				<li> <tt>json.dump(object, fileObject)</tt>: dumps an object to
				  a file. Only one object may be dumped to a file, so
				  if you want to dump multiple objects, you must bundle
				  them up into a list and then dump the list:
<pre>
>>> import json
>>> a
[3, 4, 5]
>>> x
{'nels': 5, 'brad': 3}
>>> writeList = [a, x, 543]
>>> json.dump(writeList, f)
</pre>
				<li> <tt>json.load(fileObject)</tt>: Loads the json object
				  from fileObject, parses it, and converts it to the
				  correct Python object
				</ol>
			    </ol>
			 <li> pickle: You can use the pickle module to 
			   serialize more complicated objects, such as classes.
			   We won't discuss pickling in this course.
			 </ol>

      </ol>
