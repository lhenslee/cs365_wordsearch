<h1>Functional Programming</h1>

<ol>
<li> Historical Origins
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li> Mathematical Origins: 
	In the 1930s a variety of mathematicians, including
  Alan Turing and Alonzo Church, attempted to formalize the notion
  of an effective procedure (i.e., an algorithm) for computing the solution to 
  a problem. A procedure represents a <i>constructive proof</i> of a 
  mathematical conjecture, because it provides a concrete way to obtain
  a mathematical object with some desired property. It is also possible
  to obtain <i>non-constructive proofs</i> that an object with the desired
  property must exist, for example, via contradiction. However such proofs
  are not useful in computation, because they do not yield a computational
  procedure that allows us to obtain the mathematical object. The desire
  to find effective procedures for computing solutions led 
  these mathematicians to seek constructive, computational models.
  <p>
  Turing developed the Turing Machine and Church developed the
  lambda calculus. The Turing Machine model was an imperative model
  that emphasized computing using state changes via updates to squares on
  a tape. The lambda calculus was a functional model that emphasized computing
  by composing functions and using parameters to communicate state information
  between functions. It derives its name from the greek character &lambda;, which
  Church used to
  introduce parameters to his functions.
  It was eventually proven that these two models, as well
  as several other models of computing that were developed at about the same
  time, were equivalent in terms of their expressiveness, or, put another
  way, in terms of the set of algorithms they could express. This led Church
  to conjecture that all intuitively appealing models of computing would be
  equally powerful as well. This conjecture became known as <i>Church's
  thesis</i>. 
  <p>
  <li> Conceptual Features of Functional Languages
    <ol>
      <li> Defines the outputs of a program as a mathematical function of
	the inputs
      <li> No side effects, which means no mutable state: A side effect
	is a change to the value of a name/value binding. 
	<ol>
	  <li> In pure functional languages, variables are write-once
	  <li> State information may be passed from one function to another
	    via either parameters or via return values
      <li> Emphasize recursion as opposed to iteration
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <p>
  <li> Programming Language Origins: Functional languages were first developed
    in the late 1950s by artifical intelligence researchers. Their first
    algorithms were based on branch-and-bound, tree search techniques that
    lent themselves naturally to recursion. As an example of a branch-and-bound,
    tree search technique, consider the game of chess. White moves first and
    has a variety of moves, that represent the first level of the tree. Black
    then moves and has a variety of moves in response to each move that
    White can make. These moves constitute the second level of the tree. These
    levels continue to be elaborated, with each level alternating between
    moves by White and moves by Black. A computer trying to determine the best
    move to make for either side cannot possibly hope to search the entire
    tree, and hence only searches the most promising branches. This type
    of opportunistic search gives rise to the term branch-and-bound. Recursion
    provides a natural way to search these trees. Additionally, researchers
    discovered that trees could be easily modeled using lists, where children
    were denoted as sublists. These observations led to the development of
    Lisp, which is considered the first functional language. Lisp stands
    for LISt Processing language. 
   </ol>
<p>
<li> Functional Programming Concepts: Functional languages have a variety
  of features not traditionally found in imperative languages. However, as
  you look over the following list, you will see that many of the features
  do show up in modern scripting languages, and that some of the features,
  such as garbage collection, even show up in compiled languages such as Java.
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li> 1st class functions: A 1st class value is one which
	may be returned from a function, passed as a parameter to a function,
	and created as a value and assigned to a variable (second class values may only be passed
	as parameters). 
        <p>
        Strictly speaking, most imperative languages like
	C, C++, and Java, treat functions as 2nd class values because you
	cannot dynamically create a new function and assign it to a variable.
	By contrast, many functional languages allow functions to create and
	      return functions. For example, the user of a spreadsheet
	      creates a function each time the user types a formula into
	      a cell. A functional language can handle this by passing the
	      code input by a user to a function constructor and then returning
	      the resulting function.
      <li> higher-order functions: A <i>higher-order</i> function takes a function as an 
	argument, or returns a function as a result. An example of a higher
	order function is the map function, which takes a function, such
	as one that sums its two operands, and applies it to two lists, thus
	doing a pair-wise summation of the elements of the two lists.
      <p>
	<li> serious polymorphism: Most functional languages support
	  implicit, parametric polymorphism, which means that they do not
	  require users to declare the types of variables, but instead use
	  either dynamic typing or a sophisticated type inferencing algorithm
	  to statically determine the types of variables.
      <p>
	<li> built-in lists: Lists have a natural recursive structure that
	  allows them to work nicely with recursive structures. You can 
	  recursively define a list as follows:
	  <ol>
	    <li> The empty list is nil (has no elements)
	    <li> A list of n+1 elements can be obtained from a list of n
	      elements by either prepending or appending an element to the 
	      n-element list 
	  </ol>
        <p>
        <li> structured function returns: most functional langauges allow
          all structures in their language, including lists and functions,
	  to be returned from functions. Many imperative languages
	  do not allow certain structures to be returned from a function. For
	  example, C/C++ do not allow arrays to be returned from functions, and
	  imperative languages that support nested functions typically do not
	  allow nested functions to be returned as return values from 
	  functions (because then the local variables of the enclosing
	  function could not be discarded)
	<p>
        <li> constructors for aggregates and fully general aggregates:
	  Functional languages provide function constructors which are not
	  provided by most imperative languages and they also provide ways
	  to initialize a structure "all at once". For example, the following
	  constructor creates a list in Lisp:
<pre>
(list (list 3 6 3) (list 3) (list 4 5 (list 1 2 3)))
</pre>
          While one can often do a single level of initialization in 
          imperative languages, it is frequently not possible to do 
          nested initialization, as in the above example.
        <p>
	<li> garbage collection: Both lists and the necessity of allocating
	  some local variables on the heap generate a tremendous amount of
	  temporary data that necessitates garbage collection
        </ol>
<p> 
<li> Working with Recursion (Section 6.6 of Scott)
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li> Here is an example of how you can replace looping with recursion.
	With looping the code looks as follows:
<pre>
x := 0; i := 1; j := 100;
while i < j do
    x := x + i*j; 
    i := i + 1;
    j := j - 1
end while
return x
</pre>
        With recursion the code becomes f(0,1,100), where
<pre>
f(x,i,j) { 
   if i < j then 
       f(x+i*j, i+1, j-1) 
   else x
}
</pre>
        Notice that the recursive code contains no side effects, because
        each "update" to x, i, and j occurs with fresh x, i, and j variables
        in a new stack frame. However, it still manages to modify the state
        by performing the necessary state changes in the argument expressions.
        This sort of state modification is often called a <i>continuation</i>,
        since the computation is continued in another function invocation.
<p>
   <li> The previous example does not really show functional programming
     at its most elegant, which is what happens when it models a problem
     that is truly recursive. Recurrence relations are good candidates for
     functional programming. For example, the factorial function can be written
     as:
<pre>
f(0) = 1
f(1) = 1
f(n) = n * f(n-1)
</pre>
     and this recurrence can be nicely modeled using the following recursive
     function:
<pre>
factorial(n) {
  if (n == 0 or n == 1) return 1
  else return n * f(n-1)
}
</pre>
     Similarly the greatest common divisor problem can be elegantly written
     using recursion:
<pre>
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    if (a == b) return a;
    else if (a > b) return gcd(a - b, b);
    else return gcd(a, b - a);
</pre>    
     Some other natural recursive problems involve:
     <ol>
     <li> tree traversals, such as for binary search, or preorder, inorder,
          and postorder traversals
     <li> graph traversals, especially for depth-first search
     </ol>
  <p>
  <li> Speeding up Recursion: It is often said that functional programs are slower than imperative
    programs because recursion is slower than iteration. Recursion is slower
    because it involves a function call, which in turn involves creating and
    popping a stack frame. This creation and destruction can create significant
    overhead, especially when the function does very little computation, as
    in the factorial and gcd examples shown earlier.
    <p>
    <ol>
    <li> Tail Recursion: If a function is written using tail recursion, then the
    compiler can optimize the function so that it is actually run as a
    loop. A <i>tail recursive</i> function is one in which additional
    computation never follows a recursive call. The return value is simply
    the value returned by the recursive call. The gcd function is an 
    example of a tail recursive function, but the factorial function is not, because
    the factorial function multiplies the result of the recursive call by 
    <tt>n</tt>. 
    <p>
    The compiler optimizes a tail recursive function by re-using the stack
    frame for the function, rather than creating a new one, and looping back
    to the beginning of the function after any recursive call. For example, 
    it can rewrite the above gcd function as follows:
<pre>
int gcd(int a, int b) {
start:
    if (a == b) return a;
    else if (a > b) {
        a = a - b; goto start;
    }
    else {
        b = b -a; goto start;
    }
}
</pre>
    Note that while the code executes using iteration, the programmer's
    view was a recursive one. Also note why this strategy fails with the
    factorial function. If we try to re-use factorial's stack frame, then
    the value of <tt>n</tt> is corrupted when we return from each recursive
    call. In fact it will always be 1 on the return from the recursive call,
    and hence re-using the stack frame will cause the factorial function to
    always return 1. 
    <p>
    <li> Transforming Recursion to Use Tail Recursion: Non tail-recursive
      functions can be re-written to use tail recursion by pushing the
      computation into the expressions that compute the arguments. In other
      words, I re-write the recursion so that it uses a continuation. For example,
      I can re-write the factorial function to use tail recursion as follows:
<pre>
factorial(n, product) {
   if (n == 0 or n == 1) return product
   else return fact(n-1, product * n)
}
...
print factorial(5, 1); // computes and prints 5!
</pre>
      Personally I do not like this tail-recursive version nearly as much as
      the original version. I think it is much less elegant and much harder to
      read and comprehend. This is one reason I dislike functional programming.
      If the problem is not naturally tail-recursive, then to make it efficient, 
      one often has to re-write it in an imperative style, which defeats the
      whole purpose of writing a functional program. Here's another example
      using fibonacci numbers. It has an easy recurrence relation (according
      to Wikipedia, the modern sequence is written the following way, not the
      way written in the Scott text--I will be using Wikipedia's definition):
<pre>
fib<sub>0</sub> = 0
fib<sub>1</sub> = 1
fib<sub>n</sub> = fib<sub>n-1</sub> + fib<sub>n-2</sub>
</pre>
      and a natural functional implementation:
<pre>
fib(n) {
  if (n == 0) return 0
  else if (n == 1) return 1
  else return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
}
</pre>
      Unfortunately this implementation is horribly inefficient. It is in fact
      exponential, as you can see if you try tracing the actual sequence of
      function calls. In C you could write a linear time implementation as:
<pre>
int fib(int n) {
  int f1 = 0; f2 = 1;   
  int i;
  for (i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
     int temp = f1 + f2;
     f1 = f2; f2 = temp;
  }
  return f2;
}
</pre>
     Using this implementation as a template and also assuming I can use
     nested functions, I can write a linear time
     continuation-based, functional version for the fibonacci sequence:
<pre>
fib(n) {
  fib-helper(f1, f2, i) {
    if (i == n) return f2;
    else return fib-helper(f2, f1 + f2, i+1);
  }
  return fib-helper(0, 1, 0);
}
</pre>
    While I think this example helps show the utility of nested functions, I
    think it also again shows the ugliness that mars functional programming
    when we have to worry about efficiency. The original elegance of the
    fibonacci program has been destroyed, and in my opinion, the continuation-based
    version is much harder to understand and comprehend. You may draw different
    conclusions based on your own background and proclivities.
</ol>
