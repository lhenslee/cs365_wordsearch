<h1> Garbage Collection </h1>
</center>
<hr>
Garbage collection is a process by which a run-time environment automatically
de-allocates and reclaims ununsed memory. Garbage collection 
represents a trade-off between increased code robustness
and decreased code efficiency. By freeing the programmer of the obligation
to explicitly de-allocate memory, garbage collection avoids dangling references
caused by prematurely de-allocated memory and memory leaks caused by failing
to de-allocate memory when the last pointer to the object is obliterated.
Dangling references are among the most difficult and costly error to
detect, so eliminating them can considerably speed up code development and
increase the robustness of the code.
<p>
However, garbage collection requires a considerable amount of bookkeeping
and is famously associated with pauses in a program while garbage collection
is performed. Additionally, programmers typically know when an object is
no longer needed and can be de-allocated. A programmer can manually de-allocate
an object much more directly and efficiently than a garbage collector, thus
leading to faster code.
<p>
Garbage collection algorithms fall into two broad categories: reference
counting and tracing collection. The rest of these notes explores these
algorithms in more detail.
<ol>
<li> Reference Counting
  <ol>
    <p>
	    <li> Description: Keeps track of the number of pointers that
	       reference each block of memory in the heap and adds a block
	       of memory to the free list when its reference count drops to 0
	      <ol>
	      <li> each memory block contains a four byte field which counts
	          the number of references to this block
		 <p>
	      <li> the compiler inserts statements that increment or decrement
	          reference counts around program statements that perform
		  pointer variable assignment
<pre>
		  Example:                                     Reference Counts
		                                                "Hello" "World"
		             String a = new String("Hello");       1       0
		             String b = new String("World");       1       1
			     b = a;                                2       0
			     
			     After the assignment of a to b, the string object
			     containing "World" gets garbaged collected
</pre>
            </ol>
	      <p>
	    <li> Advantages
	      <p>
	        <ol>
		<li> the cost of garbage collection is distributed uniformly
		   over a program's execution so there is never an irritating
		   pause in program execution
		</ol>
		<p>
	    <li> Disadvantages
	      <p>
	      <ol>
	      <li> reference counting statements must be added before and
		   after every program statement that performs a pointer
		   assignment. These statements can increase the cost of
		   a pointer assignment by a factor of 3.
	       <li> reference counting cannot garbage collect circular 
	           structures
	      <li> every block of memory must have an extra four bytes that
	           are devoted to reference counting. 
	      <li> assumes a strongly typed language because the compiler
		   needs to know what to do with a pointer that references
		   a field in the middle of a memory block (i.e., it needs to
		   be able to generate code that finds the reference count
		   for the memory block and increments/decrements it
		   appropriately)
	      </ol>
	    </ol>
<hr>
<li> Tracing Collectors: Tracing collectors work by marking objects as
  either usable or un-usable and reclaiming un-usable objects
  <p>
    <ol> 
      <li> Mark and Sweep
	<p>
	   <ol>
	     <li> Description: A three step method that is periodically
	         invoked to determine which objects in the heap are not
		 referenced by any chain of pointers that originates from
		 outside the heap (i.e., from a pointer currently on the
		 stack or from a global variable).
	         <p>
		 <ol>
		 <li> Step 1: Walk through the heap and mark every block as
		   "useless"
		 <p>
		 <li> Step 2: For each pointer outside the heap do a depth-first
		   search and mark all blocks that are encountered as
		   "useful." (when the collector reaches a block already
		   marked as "useful" it knows it has reached the block
		   via some other path and can stop recursing) Doing a 
		   depth-first search means having to recurse into structures.
		   For example, suppose we are given the following class
		   and variable declarations:
		   <pre>
		   class ListNode {           class List {
		       ListNode *next;	          ListNode *head;
		       ListNode *prev:		  ListNode *cursor;
		       int value;             };
		    };

		    List *a;
		   </pre>
		    When we follow a's pointer, we must recurse into List
		    and follow List's head and cursor pointers. Similarly
		    when we follow the head and cursor pointers, we will
		    have to recurse into ListNodes and follow their *next
		    and *prev pointers.
		   <p>
		 <li>Step 3: Walk through the heap again and move every block
		   still marked as "useless" to the free list
		 </ol>
	<p>
            <li> Advantages
	      <p>
	      <ol>
	        <li> requires less overhead than reference counting since it
		   is only called when free memory is exhausted
	
	        <li> garbage collects circular structures
	      </ol>
	     <p>
	    <li> Disadvantages
	      <p>
		<ol>
	        <li> can cause long annoying pauses when garbage collection
		   occurs. Since garbage collection typically occurs when
		   free memory is exhausted, a great deal of memory must be
		   typically searched. Hence the garbage collection process
		   can take a noticeable period of time and can disrupt the
		   interactivity of an application. There are some incremental
		   garbage collectors that interleave their execution with
		   the program, thus amortizing the cost of their execution.
		   These garbage collectors lead to somewhat slower overall
		   execution times, because of thread switching and more
		   bookkeeping, but can dramatically reduce the length of
		  the pauses.
		<p>
	       <li> requires a strongly typed language and each memory block 
		 must start with a pointer to a type descriptor. The reason
		 a type descriptor is required is that if the object contains
		 pointer fields, then the garbage collector must recursively
		 follow these pointer fields, and the type descriptor will
		 tell the garbage collector where in the object these pointer
		 fields are located. 
		 <p>
	       <li> the algorithms can be fairly tricky to implement. For
	           example, since garbage collection is initiated when free
		   memory is exhausted, there will not be a great deal of
		   space to store the stack required for depth-first search.
		   Hence many algorithms reverse the pointers as they 
		   traverse the heap so that they can return to their 
		   previous block when they finish recursing (see Fig 7-14
		 in the Scott book if you have it)
	       </ol>
	    </ol>
    <p>
    <li> Stop-and-Copy
      <p>
	<ol>
	  <li> Description: A technique that can eliminate memory fragmentation
	    by compacting storage. It divides the heap into two halves of equal
	    size and does all its allocation in one half. When this half fills up,
	    it copies the usable memory to the other half, compacts the storage,
	    and patches up pointers. Although it may seem that dividing the heap
	    in half cuts memory in half, that is not really the case since modern
	    processes use virtual memory that gets mapped to physical memory. Hence
	    you're really only halving virtual memory, which you can make quite
	    large using current disk sizes.
	  <p>
	    <li> Detailed Algorithm
	      <p>
	      <ol>
		<li> When a half is nearly full, the collector starts its
		  exploration of reachable data structures. Each reachable
		  block is copied into the second half of the heap, with no
		  external fragmentation
		<li> The old version of the block, in the first half of the
		  heap, is overwritten with a "useful" flag and a pointer
		  to the new location.
		<li> Any pointer that refers to the same block and that is
		  found later in the exploration is updated to point to the
		  new location.
	      </ol>
	    <p>
	    <li> Advantages
	      <p>
		<ol>
		  <li> Eliminates memory fragmentation
		  <li> Eliminates steps 1 and 3 of mark-and-sweep
		</ol>
	     <p>
	    <li> Disadvantage: Halves the heap size, although as noted earlier,
	      it only really halves virtual memory heap size
	    </ol>
<p>
         <li> Generational Collectors
	   <p>
	     <ol>
	       <li> Key Observation: Most dynamically allocated objects
		 are short-lived, so they can be placed in a "nursery"
		 region and garbage collected more quickly
	       <p>
	       <li> Detailed Description
		<p>
		  <ol>
		    <li> Memory is divided into multiple regions, often just
		      two, with one region being the nursery region and one
		      being the long-lived region
		    <li> When space runs low, the garbage collector garbage
		      collects the nursery region. If not enough space can
		      be reclaimed in the nursery region, it garbage collects
		      successively higher regions, thus weeding out older
		      lived blocks that have become un-usable. 
		    <li> After some number of collections, frequently just one,
		      blocks get promoted from their region to the next older
		      region in a manner similar to stop-and-copy.
		    <li> One complication is that there may be pointers from
		      the older regions to the newer regions and we don't want
		      to exhaustively search the older regions to update 
		      pointers when newer objects are promoted. To handle this
		      case, the compiler must generate code at each pointer
		      assignment to check whether the new pointer is an
		      old-to-new pointer. If so, it adds the pointer to a hidden
		      list accessible to the collector. This instrumentation
		      on assignment is known as a <i>write barrier</i>. In
		      general the list of old-to-new pointers is fairly short,
		      since it is relatively rare for an older object to point
		      to a newer object. 
		    </ol>
		  <p>
		  <li> Advantage: Decreases the length of pauses by garbage
		    collecting smaller regions
		  <p>
		  <li> Disadvantage: Much more complicated and can slow
		    down overall execution by requiring the instrumentation
		    of pointer assignments. However, the instrumentation is
		    pretty cheap. The nursery starts at a known region in 
			memory that ends with a bunch of 0's (e.g., 0x80000000)
			so right shift the pointer to obtain the high order
			bits of the pointer and then do a fast comparison. If
			the right shifted pointer is less than the start of
			the nursery, the pointer is into the older generations
			and otherwise is into the nursery.
