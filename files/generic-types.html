    <ol>
    <li> Polymorphism: refers to the ability of the same code to perform the
        same action on different types of data. There are two primary
	types of polymorphism:
        <ol>
	<li> Parametric polymorphism: The code takes the type as a parameter,
	    either explicitly (as in C++/Java templates) or implicitly (as in
	    Lisp, which determines the type from the data being used). Some
	    compilers, such as the C++ compiler, generate multiple copies of 
	    the code, one for each type. Other compilers, such as the Java
	    compiler, generate a single copy of the code which should work
	    with all types. This is why Java's templates cannot support
	    primitive types, because a single copy of the code cannot use
	    built-in operations, such as + or &lt;. Instead it must rely
	    on method calls, and hence it must work with objects.

	<li> Subtype  polymorphism: Subtype polymorphism is associated with
	    inheritance hierarchies. It refers to a procedure that should
	    yield the same behavior but might require different implementations
	    for different subtypes. There are two types of
	    subtype polymorphism:
	    <ol>	
	    <li> The code is shared between the super class and its children via 
		a <i>non-virtual</i> method. In this case one copy of the
		procedure works for all subtypes. 
	    <li> The super class declares a <i>virtual</i> method for which it
		expects each subclass to provide a different implementation.
		In this case the expected behavior is the same, such as to
		draw an object to the screen or to indicate whether or not a
		mouse point is contained in the object, but the implementation
		is different.
	    </ol>
        </ol>
   <li> Polymorphism in C, C++, and Java
       <ol>
       <li> Java
	 <ol>
         <li> Original approach: the developers of Java felt that C++ templates
               were too complicated, so their original solution was to provide 
               the implicit master class Object. 
	      <ol>
              <li> Generic code uses the type Object whenever it needs to refer 
	          to a specific piece of data

	      <li> Programs downcast the Object type to a specific type when they
	           retrieve an object from a generic data structure

	      <li> Disadvantages
		<ol>
	            <li> downcasting can be dangerous

	            <li> Object supports generic data structures but not generic
	               algorithms, such as quicksort, which require a common
		       comparator method
		</ol>
               <li> Advantages: One copy of the code works with multiple types
	       </ol>
           <li> All this downcasting was both bothersome to use, and ran the
                risk of run-time type conversion errors that could not be
                type-checked by the compiler. Eventually the Java developers
                introduced a simplified template mechanism. When programmers
                declare a variable to use a template type, the declaration looks
                much like a C++ template. However, the definition of a template
                type is simpler. Here's a simple declaration of a wrapper
                type:
<pre>
                public class Box&lt;<b>T</b>&gt; {

                    // T stands for "Type"
                    protected <b>T</b> t;

                    public void add(<b>T</b> t) {
                        this.t = t;
                    }

                    public <b>T</b> get() {
                        return t;
                    }
                }
</pre>
                As you can see, the type looks like a parameter to a 
                function. You are allowed to pass multiple types to a
                template. For example, a hash table would have types for
                both the key and the value objects.
<p>
                Here is a declaration of a variable of type Box, and its
                use:
<pre>
class Test {
    static public void main(String args[]) {
	Box&lt;String&gt; b = new Box&lt;String&gt;();
	b.add(args[0]);
	String myArg = b.get();
	System.out.println(myArg);
    }
}
</pre>
                <ol>
		<li> Starting with Java 1.7, you can omit the type arguments
		 required to invoke the constructor. Hence you can instead write
<pre>
Box&lt;String&gt; b = new Box&lt;&gt;();
</pre>
                <li> Java generics have the restriction that they must be
                   instantiated with a user-defined class. Hence generics
                   may not be instantiated with primitive types, such as ints.
                   If you want to use a primitive type, use its wrapper type
                   instead, such as Integer.

		<li> Java uses only one copy of the code and uses an "upper
		   bound" on the type to instantiate the code. In the above
		   example, Object is the upper bound on the type, and hence
		   the Java compiler would instantiate the code using the
		   type Object. If a Box&lt;Integer&gt; were declared, then the Java
		   compiler would then introduce explicit Integer downcasts
		   wherever necessary to make the code work.

		<li> If you forget to provide a type argument, either in
		   declaring a variable with a generic type, or in calling
		   the constructor to create an object of a generic type, then
		   you get an object with the <tt>raw type</tt> of the generic
		   class. The raw type uses Object (or the upper bound for
		   the type parameter). This can mess you up if you are
		   expecting to use specific types, since Java may give you
		   vague error messages. For example in the following code
		   I have inadvertently omitted the diamond operator from
		   the instantiation of the LinkedList constructor, which means that 
		   Java creates a LinkedList that stores Objects rather than
		   Integers. I get a vague error message:
<pre>
class Foo {
    LinkedList&lt;Integer&gt; a = new LinkedList();
  
    Foo() {
        a.add(3);
	a.add(6);
	int x = a.get(0) + a.get(1);
    }
}

UNIX&gt; javac Foo.java
Note: Foo.java uses unchecked or unsafe operations.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.
</pre>
		  If you recompile with <tt>-Xlint</tt> then the Java
		  compiler will be forthcoming about the fact that you
		  omitted the diamond operator when creating the LinkedList
		  object.
                <li> Generic Methods: You can also declare generic methods within
                   either non-generic classes, or within a generic class that
                   has a different type. For example, a generic printing method
                   that I place inside Box.java might look as follows:
<pre>
                   public &lt;V&gt; void print(V data[]) {
                       for (V val : data) {
                           System.out.println(val);
                       }
                   }
</pre>
                   Notice that there is a &lt;V&gt; in front of the void and
                   after the public keywords. If I had instead used T, I would
                   not have been required to use a leading &lt;T&gt;.
<p>
                   When I invoke a generic method, I may or may not have to
                   prefix it with the type of the object I am passing in:
<pre>
                   Box b;
                   b.&lt;String&gt;print(args);  // always works
                   b.print(args) // usually works
</pre>
                   If you do not prefix the method call with the type of the
                   object you are passing as an argument, then the java compiler
                   will attempt to use type inference to determine the type
                   of the parameter. Usually this will be successful. If the
                   java compiler cannot determine the type and gives you an
                   error message, then you will have to explicitly prefix the
                   method with the type of the object you are passing to it.

               <li> Bounded Type Parameters: Sometimes you will want to 
                   guarantee that a type implements a certain interface. For
                   example, a sort method wants to have certain comparator
                   methods defined, such as equals and lessThan. You can
                   require a type to implement either an interface or class
                   using the keyword <b>extends</b>:
    <pre>
public &lt;V extends Comparator&lt;V&gt;&gt; void sort(V data[]){...}
    </pre>
               <li> Upper Bounded Wildcards: Suppose that you write the
		 following code:
<pre>
		   List&lt;Number&gt; myList = new List&lt;Integer&gt;();
</pre>
                 This code looks like it should compile since Integer is
a subclass of Number. However, the java compiler complains
and says that List&lt;Integer&gt; is not a subclass of List&lt;Number&gt;. The
reason is that myList should be able to store any type of number, such as
a floating point number, but by assigning it a list of integers, you have
restricted it to storing only integers. Java considers this an impermissable
restriction, even though you should be able to perform any operation on
the list of integers that you could on the list of numbers. To get around
this restriction, you can use <b>upper bounded wildcards</b>, which indicates
that a variable can accept an object that contains any subtype of the upper
bound. For example the following function sums the numbers in a list and can
accept any list whose objects are a subtype of Number:
<pre>
public static double sumOfList(List&lt;? extends Number&gt; list) {
    double s = 0.0;
    for (Number n : list)
        s += n.doubleValue();
    return s;
}
</pre>
		 <p>
		   You can also use unbounded wild cards, which is a <tt>?</tt>
		   followed by nothing else. In the following
		   example, printList accepts a list
		   of any type of object:
		   <pre>
public static void printList(List&lt;?&gt; list) {
    for (Object elem: list)
        System.out.print(elem + " ");
    System.out.println();
}
</pre>		     
		<p>
		  <li> Lower Bounded Wildcards: You can also specify that
		    any supertype of an object can be accepted as a type
		    parameter. For example, suppose that you want to create
		    a list variable that can store integers, but you also
		    this variable to be able to store any type of list that
		    could store integers, such as List&lt;Number&gt; or
		    List&lt;Object&gt;. You can accomplish this by specifying
		    a lower bound with &lt;? super A&gt; where A is the
		    lower bound for the type. For our list example, we would
		    declare our variable as:
		    <pre>
List&lt;? super Integer&gt; myList;
		    </pre>
		    In my experience lower bounds never come up while upper
		    bounds do because of the desire to use subclasses in
		    place of superclasses.
		    </ol>
       <li> Type Erasure: Java compiles templates into a single piece of
	 code and it does that by replacing each template parameter with the
	 template parameter's upper bound. For example, the Box template I
	 wrote earlier in this note will be compiled as:
	 <pre>
                public class Box {

                    protected <b>Object</b> t;

                    public void add(<b>Object</b> t) {
                        this.t = t;
                    }

                    public <b>Object</b> get() {
                        return t;
                    }
                }
	 </pre>
	 The Java compiler then inserts downcasts into your code to ensure
	 that the objects get converted to the appropriate type before they
	 are used.
	 <p>
       <li> Restrictions on Java Generics
	 <p>
	 <ol>
	   <li> You cannot declare generics with primitive types, although
	     Java does auto boxing on primitive types to try to simplify
	     your life. For example, the following declaration
	     is illegal:
     <pre>
Pair&lt;int, char&gt; p = new Pair&lt;&gt;(8, 'a');  // compile-time error
             </pre>
	     However, the follow declaration is legal because Java will
	     auto box the 8 into an Integer object and the 'a' into a
	     Character object.
	     <pre>
Pair&lt;Integer, Character&gt; p = new Pair&lt;&gt;(8, 'a');
	     </pre>
	   <li> You cannot create instances of type parameters. For example,
	     you cannot create an instance of E in the following code.
<pre>
public static &lt;E&gt; void append(List&lt;E&gt; list) {
    E elem = new E();  // compile-time error
    list.add(elem);
}
</pre>
The reason for this restriction is because type erasure will
replace E with its upper bound. Hence rather than creating an instance
of E, you will create an instance of its upper bound, which is not what
you intended.
<p>
  <li> You cannot create arrays of parameterized types. For example,
    the following declaration is illegal:
    <pre>
      List&lt;Integer&gt;[] arrayOfLists = new List&lt;Integer&gt;[2];  // compile-time error
    </pre>
    The Java tutorial gives the following example to show why this declaration
    could prove problematic if it were allowed:
    <p>
<blockquote>
The following code works as you expect:
<pre>
Object[] strings = new String[2];
strings[0] = "hi";   // OK
strings[1] = 100;    // An ArrayStoreException is thrown.
</pre>
If you try the same thing with a generic list, there would be a problem:
<pre>
Object[] stringLists = new List&lt;String&gt;[2];  // compiler error, but pretend it's allowed
stringLists[0] = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();   // OK
stringLists[1] = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();  // An ArrayStoreException should be thrown,
                                            // but the runtime can't detect it.
</pre>
If arrays of parameterized lists were allowed, the previous code would fail to throw the desired ArrayStoreException.
</blockquote>
You can work around this problem by using the original "raw type" generics:
<pre>
  List [] arrayOfLists = new List[2];
</pre>
You can now insert Integers into your lists and downcast them when
you remove them.
               </ol>          
         </ol>
        <li> C++ provides <a href="templates.html">templates</a>
	  <ol>
	   <li>Disadvantages
	     <ol>
	     <li> the code is very complicated to write, to debug, and to
	          understand

	     <li> a copy of the code must be created for each different type

	     <li> templates cannot be compiled until they have been completely
		expanded, which can make the error messages almost impossible
		to read

             <li> if the template requires that a certain method or operator
		be supported (e.g., < or >), there is no way to explicitly
		declare that requirement in the template, so the programmer
		has to be aware that it is an "implicit" requirement. The
		compiler will produce an error message if the instantiated
		type does not include the necessary operation.
             </ol>
	    <li> Advantages: Supports both generic data structures and generic
	      functions
	    </ol> 
	<li> C provides void *'s
	   <ol>
	   <li> The programmer can create generic data types by declaring values
	      to be of type "void *". For example:
<pre>
struct Node {
     void *value;
     struct Node *next;
};
</pre>
	      
	   <li> The programmer can pass in type-specific functions (e.g.,
	      comparator functions) that take void *'s as parameters and
	      that downcast the void *'s to the appropriate type before
	      manipulating the data. For example, this sample program has
	      a generic min function that computes and returns the minimum
	      of two elements. As an example, we are having the sample program
	      compare two strings:
<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

// generic min function
void *min(void *element1, void *element2, int (*compare)(void *, void *)) {
    if (compare(element1, element2) &lt; 0)
	return element1;
    else
	return element2;
}

// stringCompare downcasts its void * arguments to char * and then passes
// them to strcmp for comparison
int stringCompare(void *item1, void *item2) {
    return strcmp((char *)item1, (char *)item2);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    if (argc != 3) {
	printf("usage: min string1 string2\n");
	return 1;
    }
    
    // call min to compare the two string arguments and downcast the return
    // value to a char *
    char *minString = (char *)min(argv[1], argv[2], stringCompare); 

    printf("min = %s\n", minString);
    return 0;
}
</pre>
	   <li> Advantages
	      <ol>
	      <li> One copy of the code works with multiple objects
	       
	      <li> The approach supports both generic data structures and
	           generic algorithms--Note that this approach cannot be used
		   to support generic algorithms in Java since functions cannot
		   be passed as pointers
              </ol>
	   <li> Disadvantages
	      <ol>
	      <li> Downcasting can be dangerous, even more so than in Java,
	          since run-time type checks are not performed in C

	      <li> The code often has a cluttered appearance 
	      </ol>
           </ol>
    </ol>
    <li> Both Java and C++ provide a set of generic data structures. 
      <ol>
      <li> C++ provides the standard template library (STL), which includes
	   both templates for common data structures, such as lists and
	   hash tables, as well as common algorithms, such as quicksort.

      <li> Java provides a set of standard data structures, such as lists
	   and hash tables, in its java.util package.
      </ol>
   </ol>
