<center><h1> JAR Files </h1></center>
<p>
A JAR file is similar to a tar file in that it constitutes an archive of
Java class files and source files. JAR files are created with the <b>jar</b> command and the
jar command takes many of the same arguments as tar. The jar command
automatically performs compression on your class files using the ZIP file
format. 
<p>
You can use the jar command to package all the class files for your application
into a single file. If you also tell the jar command the main class to access
within the jar file, then you can treat the jar file as a pseudo-object file.
Finally, if you want, you can also include your source files in the jar file, although
normally you would not do so. In this course we want you to submit both your class and
source files, so you will be including the source files in your jar file.
<p>
The following table, which I copied from Sun's tutorial website on the jar
command, shows the most common uses of the jar command:

<h2> Specifying an Application's Entry Point </h2>
<p>
You can tell java how to find the entry point within your jar file by creating
a <b>manifest</b> file. A manifest file can have any name you choose although
<tt>manifest.txt</tt> is a commonly chosen one.
A manifest file should contain the following
single statement:
<p>
<b>Main-Class</b>: classname
<p>
<b>Main-Class</b> is a required keyword and <i>classname</i> is the name of
the class that contains your application's <tt>main</tt> method. 
<p>
Here is an example manifest file for an application whose main class
is <tt>SalaryList</tt>:
<p>
<tt>Main-Class: SalaryList</tt>
<p>
If you are using packages, then you need to fully qualify the class name. 
Here is an example manifest file for an application whose main class is
named LexDriver and which is contained in a package named formula:
<p>
<tt>Main-Class: formula.LexDriver</tt>
<p>
<p>
<h3> Creating a Jar File that Contains a Manifest </h3>
<p>
When you create your jar file, you can include <i>m</i> as a command
line option. This option causes java to use the file specified after the 
<i>m</i> flag as the manifest file. For example, if the above file is named
<tt>manifest.txt</tt> and your files are in a directory named <tt>formula</tt>,
you could create your jar file with the following command:
<p>
<tt> jar cmf manifest.txt formula.jar formula </tt>
<p>
Note that you can specify all of your flags before specifying the files. The
files should be specified in the same order as the flags. The name of the jar
file does <i>not</i> have to be the same as your main class.
<p>
<h3> A Simpler Way to Specify the Application Entry Point </h3>
<p>
The jar tool has a <tt>-e</tt> flag that allows you to specify the
application's entry point without creating a manifest file. For example
the command:
<pre>
jar cfe Salary.jar SalaryList *.class
</pre>
will automatically create a manifest file that contains SalaryList as
the application entry point.
<p>
<h3> Executing a Jar File with an Application Entry Point </h3>
<p>
In order to execute a jar file that has an entry point specified, invoke
java with the -jar option and the jar file's name. For example:
<p>
<tt> java -jar formula.jar </tt>
<p>
<h2> Some Example Jar Creation Commands </h2>
<p>
Here are some sample commands for creating jar files. All of the example commands assume that
the manifest file is named <tt>manifest.txt</tt>. If you choose to use a different name for
the manifest file, then change <tt>manifest.txt</tt> to whatever file name you choose.
<p>
<ol>
<li> You are in the directory that contains the .class files, and you only want to include the
	.class files.
<pre>
jar cmf manifest.txt foo.jar *.class
</pre>
<li> You are in the directory that contains the .class files, and you want to include both the
	.java and the .class files.
<pre>
jar cmf manifest.txt foo.jar *.class *.java
</pre>
<li> You are in the directory that contains the .class files, and you only want to include the
	.class files associated with the class <tt>foo</tt>.
<pre>
jar cmf manifest.txt foo.jar foo*.class
</pre>
	This command will scoop up both the foo.class file and any nested classes declared in
	the foo class.
<p>
<li> Your files are in the hw1 directory and you are in hw1's parent directory. You want to include both the .class files
	and .java files associated with the class <tt>foo</tt>:
<pre>
jar cmf hw1/manifest.txt foo.jar hw1/foo*.class hw1/foo.java
</pre>
<li> Your files are in a package named silhouette and you are in silhouette's parent directory. You
	want to include both the .class and the .java files for silhouette. <b>If you are jarring up a package, then
	make sure that you are in the parent directory, since it is vital that the entire directory
	tree for the package end up in the jar file</b>:
<pre>
jar cmf silhouette/manifest.txt silhouette.jar silhouette
</pre>
</ol>
<p>
<h2> Warnings about Using Jar and Manifest Files </h2>
<p>
<ol>
<li> <b>The
manifest file must end with a new line or carriage return. The last line will
not be parsed properly if it does not end with a new line or carriage
return.</b>
<p>
<li> Normally you will jar up a directory tree and the directory tree will
     contain all the files needed for your application. However, should you
     wish to include files from other packages, then
     you can use the -C flag to change to these packages' parent directory and then grab the
     packages directoriess. For example, suppose that you are jarring up the foo.class, and
     that foo creates an instance of play.Hello, which can be found in 
     /Users/bvz/cs102/play/Hello.class. If you try to type:
<pre>
jar cmf manifest.txt foo.jar foo.class /Users/bvz/cs102/play/Hello.class
</pre>
     then your jar file won't work properly, because Hello.class will get
     included in your jar file as /Users/bvz/cs102/play/Hello.class. If instead
     you try to type:
<pre>
jar cmf manifest.txt foo.jar foo.class /Users/bvz/cs102/play/
</pre>
     then the play directory will be represented in your jar file as /Users/bvz/cs102/play,
     rather than as play and java will not be able to locate the Hello.class file.
     Instead you should type:
<pre>
jar cmf manifest.txt foo.jar foo.class -C /Users/bvz/cs102/ play/Hello.class
</pre>
     The -C flag causes the jar command to "cd" to the /Users/bvz/cs102/
     directory and then grab the play/Hello.class (it will create a directory for play
     in your jar file and store Hello.class in the play directory). The jar file will now contain
     foo.class and play/Hello.class, which is what you want.
<p>
<li> <b>If you use the -jar option, the java interpreter expects all user 
     classes to be bundled in 
     either the jar file or in jar files that are referenced by the manifest 
     file's Class-Path parameter.</b> (The specific statement can be found
     in the documentation for java's -jar flag and reads 
     "When you use this option, the JAR file is the source of all user 
     classes, and other user class path settings are ignored.")
     The Class-Path parameter may only contain
     references to jar files and the jar files must be in directories local
     to the machine on which the jar file is being run, not in the jar file
     itself. The Class-Path parameter may not specify directories in either
     the jar file itself, or on the local machine that contain class files.
     If you want classes in your jar file to access external class files 
     that simply exist in a directory, such as for example,
     java_cup/runtime classes, 
     then you are out of luck and cannot use the -jar option with java. 
<p>
<li> While you are allowed to embed .jar files within an outer .jar file,
  you will not be able to load this embedded .jar file into your program
  without writing custom code. The Class-Path parameter described in the
  previous bullet point cannot be used to load embedded .jar files into
  your program. I personally have never seen the custom code required to
  load an embedded jar file into your program but you could probably google
  it.
