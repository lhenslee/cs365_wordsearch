<h2>Modules</h2>
</center>
<hr>
Modules provide a way to allow several related files to share the details
of their implementation while hiding this implementation from the outside
world. Modules provide an added layer of flexibility to classes in the way 
of access protection. These notes outline the differences in data encapsulation
afforded by C, C++, and Java.
<p>
<hr>
<h2> Module Mechanisms in C: Void *'s </h2>
<p>
C has a very weak form of data encapsulation that is provided via the 
generic <tt>void *</tt> pointer and the ability to declare that a struct
is local to a file. Suppose I want to declare a <b>Stack</b> data type in
C and I want to hide its implementation, including its data structures, from
users. I can do this by first defining a public file called <tt>Stack.h</tt>
that contains my generic Stack data type and the functions that the stack
data type supports:
<pre>
Stack.h:
    typedef void * Stack;
    Stack stack_new(int size);
    void stack_free(Stack s);
    void stack_push(Stack s, int value);
    int stack_pop(Stack s);
</pre>
Note that I have prefaced all my function names with the "stack_" prefix so
that I can avoid name conflicts with user selected names. C++ and Java have
ways to avoid these name conflicts and they will be discussed later.
<p>
Next I create my <tt>stack.c</tt> file that contains the implementation for
my stack data type:
<pre>
#include "stack.h"
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

typedef struct {
   int size;
   int *data;
   int top;
} myStack;

Stack stack_new(int size) {
   myStack *newStack = (myStack *)malloc(sizeof(myStack));
   newStack-&gt;size = size;
   newStack-&gt;data = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int) * size);
   newStack-&gt;top = 0;
   return (Stack)newStack;  /* cast myStack to a (void *) */
}

void stack_push(Stack s, int value) {
   myStack *stack = (myStack *)s;
   if (stack-&gt;top == stack-&gt;size) return;  /* should really do error handling */
   stack-&gt;data[stack-&gt;top] = value;
   stack-&gt;top++;
}
...
</pre>
Since <tt>myStack</tt> is declared locally and is not declared extern
in the <tt>stack.h</tt> file, its scope is limited to <tt>stack.c</tt>.
Hence only the functions in <tt>stack.c</tt> can manipulate the <tt>myStack</tt>
data structure. The user is handed a <tt>(void *)</tt> which effectively
hides a stack's implementation because there is no way for the user to
cast the <tt>(void *)</tt> to a <tt>myStack</tt>. Whenever the user wants
to manipulate the stack the user passes a <tt>(void *)</tt> to the appropriate
stack function. The stack function can cast this <tt>(void *)</tt> to a
<tt>myStack</tt> struct and manipulate the stack in any way it wishes. 
<p>
This form of data encapsulation using <tt>void *'s</tt> is fairly kludgy but
it does allow several files to share their implementation, as long as each
file declares its local data structures in exactly the same way. For example,
I could spread the stack implementation over two files by declaring a
<tt>myStack</tt> struct locally in both files. The obvious drawback to this
approach is that instead of having one central declaration for the stack's
data structures I have one declaration per file, which makes it much more
difficult and error-prone to change the data structures. 
<p>
A positive aspect of the <tt>void *</tt> implementation is that you can
hand a binary implementation to a third party without divulging any proprietary
implementation knowledge because the third party will only see the 
<tt>void *</tt> in the .h file. Hence the third party will not even know
what data structures you are using.

<h2> Module Mechanisms in C++: Friends and Namespaces </h2>
<p>
The <tt>public</tt>, <tt>protected</tt>, and <tt>private</tt> accessors
in C++ provide a way to control access to the implementation of a class.
Unfortunately, these accessors are "all" or "nothing" accessors, they either
let everyone access the implementation or only subclasses to access the
implementation. They do not provide a way to say "let classes A, B, and C
have access to each other's implementation, but exclude everyone else."
<p>
C++'s developers partially address this problem by providing the
<tt>friend</tt> keyword. 
A class can declare that other classes are its friends, which allow
          the other classes to examine the protected and private instance
	  variables of the class. For example:
<pre>
	  class ListNode {
	     friend class List;
		...
	  };
</pre>
This declaration gives any method in <tt>List</tt> the ability to examine
any variable in <tt>ListNode</tt> and to call any method in <tt>ListNode</tt>,
regardless of whether or not the access protection is public.
<p>
Friendship has a number of klunky disadvantages. First it is not two way. 
When you declare List to be ListNode's
           friend, ListNode does not become a friend of List. List must
	   explicitly declare ListNode to be a friend before the friendship
	   becomes two way.
Second, subclasses do not inherit a superclass's friendship status.
For example, suppose you have the following subclass declaration:
<pre>
           class DList : public List { ... }
</pre>
DList is not considered a friend of ListNode, despite the fact that it is
a subclass of a friend of ListNode. 
<p>
These restrictions are incredibly annoying and really limit
the effectiveness of friends in C++. First, if you want classes A, B, and C
to share their implementation, you must ensure that all the classes mutually
refer to each other as friends. Second, if you want their subclasses to
also be friends, which invariably you do, then you have to make sure that
the subclasses mutually refer to each other as friends. In general, if you
want <i>n</i> classes to be friends, you will need <i>n(n-1)</i> friend
declarations. In addition, if you add a new class to the system that should
be included amongst the friends, then you must remember to add <i>2n</i> more
friend declarations. What a mess! 
<p>
The second module-related concept in C++ is that of <b>namespace's</b>.
The <tt>namespace</tt> keyword allows a
programmer to specify that a certain set of variables, functions, and 
classes belong to the same library or "module". 
For example, a programmer might write:
<pre>
namespace ibm {
    class Stack { ... };
    class List { ... };
    class ListNode { ... };
    class Consult { ... };
    ...
}

namespace apple {
    class Stack { ... };
    class List { ... };
    class ListNode { ... };
    class Cut { ... };
    ...
}
</pre>
Notice that the same set of names have been re-used, but since they are
in two different namespaces, that is ok. There are three common ways to
access members of a namespace:
<ol>
<li> On an as-needed basis with the :: operator: 
<pre>
ibm::Stack *s = new ibm::Stack();
</pre>
<p>
<li> Importing specific members into the current namespace 
with the <b>using</b> keyword:
<pre>
using ibm::Stack;

Stack *s = new Stack();
</pre>
<li> Importing all members into the current namespace with the
<b>using</b> keyword:
<pre>
using namespace ibm;

Stack *s = new Stack();
</pre>
</ol>
<p>
If you import conflicting names into the same namespace it is problematic
only if you try to use that name:
<pre>
using namespace ibm;
using namespace apple;

Consult *c = new Consult();  // ok--no name conflict
Stack *s = new Stack();      // compiler error because of a name conflict
</pre>
Namespaces can span one or more files, so you can still place declarations
in a .h file and definitions in a .cpp file. 
For example, to declare the
methods for ibm's Stack class one could use any of the following three styles
in an ibm.cpp file:
<table border class="code">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
#include "ibm.h"
using namespace ibm;

int Stack::pop() { ... }
...
</pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre>
#include "ibm.h"

int ibm::Stack::pop() { ... }
...
</pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre>
#include "ibm.h"

namespace ibm {
   int Stack::pop() { ... }
   ...
}
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
C++ implements its standard template library using the <b>std</b>
namespace. This library provides a number of pre-defined data structures,
such as vectors and lists. 
<p>
Namespaces solve another of C's problems, which is
that all variable, function, and class names end up in the same global name
space. This common grouping can create problems when you combine third
party software from two different vendors, who duplicate one or more names,
as shown above.
<p>
Unfortunately C++'s developers did not create true modules with the
<tt>namespace</tt> keyword. Unlike Java's packages, 
C++'s namespaces do not provide
a way to share implementation among members of the namespace. If ListNode
and List are declared in the same namespace, they still cannot access one
another's members without using the <tt>friend</tt> keyword. It would have 
been nice if they also added the concept
of package-level access so that one could truly create modules in C++, but
they didn't. As a result Java has a much more powerful module mechanism than
C++. 
<p>

<h2> Packages Versus Friends--A Summary</h2>
<p>
<ol>
    <li> Packages in Java provide a way to organize a group of related
       classes and allow them to seamlessly refer to each other's implementation
       while protecting their implementation from the prying eyes of outside
       classes
<p>
    <li> Friends provide a less elegant way in C++ to organize a group of
       related classes and allow them to refer to each other's implementation
       while protecting their implementation from the prying eyes of outside
       classes
<p>
       <ol>
       <li> A class declares its variables as protected, and may even declare
          its constructors as protected if it does not want outside classes
	  to create instances of the class
<p>
       <li> A class can declare that other classes are its friends, which allow
          the other classes to examine the protected and private instance
	  variables of the class. Here's an example:
	 <pre>
	 class ListNode {
	    friend class List;
	    ...
         };
	 </pre>
	 <p>
       <li> Friendship is not two way: when you declare List to be ListNode's
           friend, ListNode does not become a friend of List. List must
	   explicitly declare ListNode to be a friend before the friendship
	   becomes two way
       <p>
	 <li> Subclasses do not inherit a superclass's friendship status. For
	   example, if you have the following class declaration:
	   <pre>
           class DList : public List { ... }
	   </pre>
	   then DList is not considered a friend of ListNode.
	   This restriction is incredibly annoying and really limits
	   the effectiveness of friends in C++
	 </ol>
</ol>
       The above discussion of the drawbacks of friends should
       make it clear that Java provides a much cleaner way to group related
       classes so that they can share their implementation while protecting
       their implementation from the outside world.
