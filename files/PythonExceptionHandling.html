<li> Overview: Python's exception handling mechanism is very similar to 
  Java's exception handling mechanism. It has a try...except format that
  looks as follows:
<pre>
try:
    protected code
except ExceptionName<sub>1</sub> as e<sub>1</sub>:
    error handling code
except ExceptionName<sub>2</sub> as e<sub>2</sub>:
    error handling code
except ExceptionName<sub>3</sub>:
    error handling code
except:
    unconditional error handling code
    raise   # re-raises the exception
else:
    code to execute if the try completes <b>successfully</b>. 
    This code is non-protected code (i.e., code we do not
    expect to cause an exception)
finally: 
    code executed regardless of whether an exception occurs, and
    regardless of whether an exception is handled if one occurs
</pre>
Here is an example from the Python tutorial:
<pre>
import sys

try:
    f = open('myfile.txt')
    s = f.readline()
    i = int(s.strip())
except IOError as e:
    print "I/O error({0}): {1}".format(e.errno, e.strerror)
except ValueError:
    print "Could not convert data to an integer."
except:
    print "Unexpected error:", sys.exc_info()[0]
    raise
</pre>
The try mechanism operates as follows:
<ul>
<li> The try clause is executed.
<li> If no exception occurs, the except clause is skipped and execution of the 
  try statement is finished. If the optional <tt>else</tt> clauses is
  present, then the <tt>else</tt> code is executed. Then code in the
  optional <tt>finally</tt> clause is executed. The finally clause is
  executed even if the else code triggers an exception.
<li> If an exception occurs the rest of the try clause is skipped. If the
  exception's type matches one of the exceptions named in the except list,
  then the appropriate except clause is executed, followed by the
  optional <tt>finally</tt> clause.
<li> If an exception occurs which does not match any exception named in the 
  except clause, it is passed on to outer try statements; 
  if no handler is found, it is an unhandled exception and execution stops 
  with a message printed to the console window or the interpreter. Before
  the exception is passed on, the optional <tt>finally</tt> clause is
  executed.
</ul>
  <p>
  It is permissable to write user-defined exceptions, which we will consider
  in the section on <a href="#UserExceptions">user exceptions</a>.
<p>
<li> What to put in <tt>try</tt> and what to put in <tt>else</tt>
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li> You should put code that you suspect might cause an exception in the <tt>try</tt>
  clause. 
      <li> You should put code that should conclude the try statement and
	that should not cause an exception in the <tt>else</tt> clause. Thus
	if an unexpected error occurs, the exception most likely will be
	thrown to an outer try statement, rather than being handled by the
	current try statement's except clauses.
     </ol>
<p>
<li> The <tt>except</tt> clause
  <ol>
  <p>
  <li> An except clause may contain a comma-separated, parenthesized list
    of exceptions:
<pre>
except (RuntimeError, TypeError, NameError):
</pre>
    Make sure that the list is parenthesized. Old-style Python allowed you to
    bind a variable to an exception object using the syntax:
<pre>
except Exception, variable
</pre>
    so if you omit the parentheses in the above statement, Python will try
    to bind the variable named TypeError to the exception object for
    RuntimeError, which is not what you intend.
<p> 
   <li> You can bind a variable to the exception object using the syntax:
<pre>
except Exception as variable:
</pre>
     For example:
<pre>
except IOError as e:
</pre>
     <tt>e.args</tt> will contain a list of the arguments passed to
     the exception object.
    <p>
   <li> The first exception matched in the except list is the clause that
     is executed. The remaining clauses will be ignored.
     <p>
       <ol> 
	 <li> Exceptions should be listed from more specific to more general. 
	   Otherwise the general exception will mask the specific exception.
	   For example:
<pre>
except Exception:
   ...
except IOError:
   ...
</pre>
           The "except IOError" will never get executed because an exception
           will always match the first clause.
         <p>
         <li> If an exception occurs in an except clause, it is immediately
	   passed on to an outer try handler. However the current try's
	   <tt>finally</tt> method is executed first.
       </ol>
   </ol>
<p>
<li> Raising Exceptions
  <ol>
    <li> The <tt>raise</tt> statement raises an exception. Usually it would
      be used to raise a user-defined exception by creating an instance of
      a user-defined class:
<pre>
raise NameError('HiThere')
</pre>
    <li> You can re-raise an exception by simply typing:
<pre>
raise
</pre>
      in an except clause. It will then re-raise the exception by passing the 
      exception to an outer try clause. Obviously this should be the last
      statement in your except clause.
   </ol>
<li id="UserExceptions"> User Exceptions
   <ol>
   <li> User exceptions are created by subclassing the pre-defined
     Python <tt>Exception</tt> class:
<pre>
class NameError(Exception):
  pass
</pre>
   <li> Any arguments you pass to the constructor for a user-defined exception
     will be automatically stored in an attribute named <tt>args</tt>. For
     example:
<pre>
try:
  raise NameError('Hi There', 5)
except NameError as e:
  for v in e.args:
    print v
</pre>
    produces the output:
<pre>
Hi There
5
</pre>
   <li> You can also define a constructor that will store the arguments in
     specific attributes. In this case an except clause must access the
     arguments through the specific attributes rather than the <tt>args</tt> 
     attribute. The <tt>args</tt> attribute disappears since it was created
     by the default constructor, which you have now overridden.
<pre>
class NameError(Exception):
  def __init__(self, name, value):
    self.name = name
    self.value = value

try:
  raise NameError('Hi There', 5)
except NameError as e:
  print 'NameError:', e.name, "and error code =", e.value
</pre>
   <li> Common Bug: Don't forget to make your exception subclass <tt>Exception</tt>.
     If you write:
<pre>
class NameError:
  pass

try:
  raise NameError('Hi There', 5)
except NameError as e:
  for v in e.args:
    print v
</pre>
     then you will get the error message:
<pre>
TypeError: this constructor takes no arguments
</pre>
     The reason is that NameError is no longer a subclass of Exception and
     hence there is no default constructor that converts the constructor's arguments
     to a list that is placed in the <tt>args</tt> attribute.
  </ol>
</ol>
