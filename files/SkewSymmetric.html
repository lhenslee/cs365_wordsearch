<h2>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2>
A skew symmetric matrix M satisfies MT = -M, where MT denotes the transpose of the matrix M and -M denotes the matrix obtained by multiplying each entry of M by -1. The transpose of a matrix M is obtained by replacing the element in the i'th row and j'th column of M with the element in the j'th row and i'th column of M. Note that this requires the diagonal elements of a skew-symmetric matrix to be equal to 0.
Create a class SkewSymmetric which contains a method minChanges. The method will take a 
two dimensional matrix M of integers.
The j'th number in the i'th element of M represents the value at row i and column j of the matrix. The method should return the minimum number of values in M that must be changed such that the resulting matrix is skew symmetric.
<p>
You must also write a main procedure that will take the rows of the matrix
as command line arguments. Each row will consist of a string of <i>n</i>
integers. You will need to use a Scanner object to extract the integers from
the strings and insert them into a matrix, which you will then pass to
minChanges.

<h2>CONSTRAINTS</h2>
<ol>
<li>Each element of M will be a single space separated list of exactly n integers, where n is the number of elements in M.
<li>Each integer in M will be between -99 and 99 inclusive, with no extra leading zeros.
<li>The integer zero will be represented as '0' (quotes for clarity) only, and not '-0' (quotes for clarity) in M.
</ol>

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
<pre>
0) java SkewSymmetric "1 2 8" "-2 1 0" "3 99 3"

Returns: 5

One possible skew-symmetric matrix obtained by changing 5 elements in M is:

  0  2  -3
 -2  0 -99
  3 99   0

Note that the diagonal elements must be 0.
