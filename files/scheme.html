<hr>
These notes cover the rudimentary aspects of Scheme. Because I wish to
emphasize the functional aspects of Scheme, these notes do not cover looping
constructs--I want you to write your Scheme programs recursively. I also will
not be covering side-effect inducing statements, such as set!, again because
I wish to emphasize the functional aspects of Scheme. You can
download a version of Scheme from the GNU site.
<p>
<ol>
<li> Historical Origins: Scheme is a simplified teaching dialect of Lisp.
<li> Basic Syntax: Lists form the basis of everything in Scheme, including
  both the representation of data and of commands. All Scheme commands
  start with an operator, followed by a list of operands. This notation is
  called both <i>prefix notation</i> and <i>Cambridge
  Polish notation</i>. Lists are enclosed in parentheses, (), so a sample
  Scheme expression for adding two numbers would be:
<pre>
(+ 3 4)
</pre>
  If I wanted to write an arithmetic expression like 
  <tt>(a + 10) * (b - 20)</tt>, I would write:
<pre>
(* (+ a 10) (- b 20))
</pre>
  A function call has a similar syntax. If I want to call the function
  <tt>avg</tt> on three variables, I would write:
<pre>
(avg x y z)
</pre>
  Although prefix notation takes some getting used to, it does have an
  advantage of conciseness when writing out an arithmetic expression involving
  the same operator. For example, the sum <tt>(a + b + c + x + y + z)</tt>
  can be concisely specified as:
<pre>
(+ a b c x y z)
</pre>
 <ol>
 <li> Comments: Comments start with a semi-colon (;). Anything following
 a semi-colon to the end of the line is a comment. For example:
<pre>
; add two numbers
(+ 3 7)  ; the result is 10
</pre>
 In imperative languages
 semi-colons frequently delimit statements, but right parentheses
 perform this function in Scheme.
  <p>
  <li> Printing Stuff
    <ol>
      <li> The <tt>display</tt> function prints a value, including
	lists. It can only print a single argument.
      <li> The <tt>newline</tt> function prints a newline.
      <li> Example:
<pre>
(display "The result is ")
(display (+ 3 4))
(newline)
</pre>
     </ol>
   <li> Debugging: You may or may not find the following two debugging
     information helpful:
     <ol>
       <li> (trace function-name): Shows the input arguments and output value 
            when the function is called. Redefining the function, such as by 
	    loading a file that defines it, undoes the tracing.
       <li> <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~gambit/doc/gambit.html#Debugging">Gambit debugging commands</a>
     </ol>
<p>
     I typically use a combination of the trace function and display statements
	to debug my scheme programs.
  </ol>
<p>
<li> The Scheme Interpreter: Most Scheme implementations employ an
  interpreter that runs a "read-eval-print" loop
  (often abbreviated REPL). The interpreter repeatedly reads an expression
  from standard input, evaluates that expression, and prints the resulting
  value. On our departmental machines, you can invoke the gambit scheme interpreter
  by typing:
<pre>
gsi
</pre>
  You can now start typing expressions and it will immediately print the
  result:
<pre>
(+ 3 4)
7
(/ (+ 8 10 10) 3)
28 / 3     ; Lisp supports rational numbers
</pre>
  If you make a mistake, such as typing an undefined variable, you will
  see something like:
<pre>
&gt; a
*** ERROR IN (console)@1.1 -- Unbound variable: a
1&gt; 
</pre>
  Type <tt>,t</tt> to get back to the main prompt. 
  <p>
  To quit the interpreter you can from the main prompt
  type any of the following: <tt>,q</tt>, <tt>(exit)</tt>, or Ctrl-D.
<p>
  You may load programs from a file using the <tt>load</tt> function:
<pre>
(load "qsort.scm")   ; .scm is the common Scheme suffix
</pre>
  Each time you load "qsort.scm", it will evaluate all the expressions
  in "qsort.scm" and update any previously declared bindings with the
  new results. In particular, previous function definitions will be overwritten
  with new function definitions, and hence it is unnecessary to exit the
  scheme interpreter if you want to fix a program. Instead you edit the file
  and then reload it.
<p>
<li> Basic Lisp Data Types: Lisp supports the usual set of data types--numbers,
  strings, and boolean values:
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li> numbers: In addition to integers and floating point numbers, Scheme
	also supports rational numbers, such as <tt>28/3</tt>. When you
	perform division on integer numbers, Scheme returns a rational number
	if there is a non-zero remainder, rather than a floating point number.
      <li> strings: Strings are enclosed in double quotes.
	For example "Brad" is a string. You may think that 'Brad' is also
	a string, because it gets accepted by the Lisp interpreter. However,
	'Brad' is really the symbol <tt>Brad'</tt> (see symbols below). 
      <li> boolean values: #t and #f represent the values <tt>true</tt> and 
	<tt>false</tt> respectively. 
      <li> symbols: Sometimes you will wish to store a symbolic reference
	to an identifer, without having it be evaluated. You can do so by
	prefixing the identifier with a quote ('). For example, <tt>'a</tt>
	allows you to store a symbolic reference to the identifier <tt>a</tt>
	without evaluating it. This can be helpful when creating functions
	or expressions dynamically. 
      <li> characters: Characters are rather clunky in Lisp and we won't deal
        with them. They start with the notation <tt>#\</tt>. For example,
        the character 'a' in C is represented as <tt>#\a</tt> in Scheme.
      </ol>
<p>
<li> Lists: Lists are a built-in data type in Scheme and are the most common
  way of representing structured data. They are created using the <tt>list</tt>
  keyword:
<pre>
(list 3 8 10)
(list "brad" 7 #t (list 5 8) (list 4 3.2 #t))
(list)   ; the empty list
</pre>
  As you can see, lists can contain heterogenous values and may be nested.
  The list keyword can be a bit verbose, and so you can also create lists
  by quoting them:
<pre>
'(3 8 10)
'("brad" 7 #t (5 8) (4 3.2 #t))
'()  ; the empty list
</pre>
  There is one important distinction between creating a list using a quote versus
  creating a list using the list command. If you use the list command, then all
  executable expressions will be evaluated, whereas if you use a quote to create
  the list, then the executable expressions will not be evaluated and instead
  the individual components of the expression will appear as symbols in the
  created list. For example:
<pre>
(list (+ 4 5) (+ 3 8))   ; creates the list '(9 11)
'((+ 4 5) (+ 3 8))       ; creates the list '((+ 4 5) (+ 3 8))
</pre>
  <ol>
  <li> cons cells: Lists are created from <i>cons</i> cells, each of which contains two
  pointers, one to the list element and one to the next cons cell. For 
  example:
<pre>
-----   -----   -----
| | |-->| | |-->| |/|
-----   -----   -----
 |       |       |
 3       8      10
</pre>
  Primitive elements, such as numbers or strings, are often called <i>atoms</i>.
  You can also create a cons cell consisting of two atoms using the <tt>cons</tt>
  command:
<pre>
(cons 6 8)
</pre>
  which will be displayed by the scheme interpreter as <tt>(6 . 8)</tt>.
  Such a cons cell is often called an <i>improper list</i>.
  A <i>proper</i> list always ends with a nil (empty) list. In other words,
  in a proper list, the final cons cell has a null pointer as its second
  element.
  <p>
  <li> basic list operations: The most basic list operations are the ones
    that construct them (cons, append) or extract their components (car, cdr,
    and their variants)
    <ol>
      <li> list constructors
	<ol>
	  <li> (cons x y): returns a cons cell with the elements <tt>x</tt> and 
	       <tt>y</tt>.
	  <li> (append list<sub>1</sub> list<sub>2</sub> ... list<sub>n</sub>):
	       merges the argument lists into a single list and returns that
	       list, leaving the individual arguments untouched
<pre>
(cons '8 '(10))    ==> (8 10)  ; the list consisting of 8 and 10
(append '(10 15) '(8) '(6 10 14)) ==> '(10 15 8 6 10 14)
</pre>
        </ol>
      <li> list extractors
	<ol>
	  <li> (car list): returns the first element of the list. So named
	    because the assembly language instruction used to implement this
	    operation in the first Lisp implementation was called
	    "contents of address register". Technically car returns the
            first element of a cons cell. Scheme provides the <tt>first</tt>,
	    <tt>second</tt> and <tt>third</tt> functions as more mnemonic
	    ways to extract the first, second, and third elements of
	    a list. <b>Unfortunately, the gambit interpreter does not
 	    support first, second, third, etc., so you must use car and
	    cdr instead.</b>
          <li> (cdr list): returns the remaining elements in the list. So named
	    because the assembly language instruction used to implement this
	    operation in the first Lisp implementation was called
	    "contents of decrement register". Technically cdr returns the
	    second element of a cons cell, which is typically a pointer to
	    the rest of the list.
          <li> Scheme supports various combinations of these two commands to
	    extract elements near the front of a list. For example <tt>cadr</tt>
	    is short hand for <tt>(car (cdr ...))</tt> and returns the second
	    element of a list. Similarly <tt>caddr</tt> returns the third
	    element of a list. You can experiment with other forms to see 
	    whether or not Scheme supports them.
<pre>
(car '(8 10 15))   ==> 8       ; the first element of the list
(cdr '(8 10 15))   ==> '(10 15) ; the rest of the list  
(car '())          ==> ERROR  ; the empty list has no elements
(cdr '())          ==> ERROR  ; the empty list has no elements
(cdr '(10))        ==> '() ; the empty list '()
(first '(8 10 15)) ==> 8
(second '(8 10 15)) ==> 10
</pre>
          </ol>
	<li> the <tt>nil</tt> value (<b>don't use it--it's undefined!</b>): In Scheme, the symbol <tt>nil</tt> used
	  to represent the empty list, <tt>'()</tt>. However, it has now
	  been abolished from the standard, so use <tt>'()</tt> instead if
	  you want to denote an empty list. For example:
<pre>
(list? (cons 3 '()))   ; returns #t
</pre>
        <li> Finding elements of a list: If you want to determine whether
	  or not an element is in a list, you can use one of <tt>memq</tt>,
	  <tt>memv</tt>, or <tt>member</tt>. For example:
<pre>
(memq 3 '(6 3 4))   ; returns #t
(memq 8 '(6 3 4))   ; returns #f
</pre>
         <tt>memq</tt> uses the <tt>eq?</tt> function to compare elements,
	 <tt>memv</tt> uses the <tt>eqv?</tt> function to compare elements,
	 and <tt>member</tt> uses the <tt>equal?</tt> function to compare
	 elements. Click <a href="#comparison">here</a> for more details
	 about the <tt>eq?</tt>, <tt>eqv?</tt>, and <tt>equal?</tt> functions.
        </ol>
       <li> Association Lists: You can treat lists like associative maps
	 if you create a list of pairs. The first element of the pair
	 represents the key and the second element of the pair represents
	 the value. For example:
<pre>
(define a '(("brad" 3) ("nels" 6) ("summer" 10)))
</pre>
         You can return the pair associated with a key in an association
         list by using the <tt>assoc</tt> function:
<pre>
(assoc "summer" a)   ; returns ("summer" 10)
</pre>
	 <tt>assoc</tt> uses the <tt>equal?</tt> function to check for
	 equality. You can also use <tt>assq</tt> or <tt>assv</tt>, which
	 will use the <tt>eq?</tt> and <tt>eqv?</tt> functions respectively 
	 to check for equality.
     </ol>
<p>
<li> Type Predicate Functions: Scheme provides a number of type predicate
  functions that allow you to determine what type of value you are examining.
  The most useful ones are:
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li> (string? x): is x a string?
      <li> (number? x): is x a number?
      <li> (pair? x): is x a cons cell?
      <li> (list? x): is x a list?
      <li> (null? x): is x the empty list?
    </ol>
<p>
<li> Variables
  <ol>
    <li> Scheme uses dynamic typing so you do not have to declare the type
      of a variable--its type is determined by the value currently assigned to it
    <li> Scheme uses static scoping
    <li> You must declare a variable before you use it. There are two ways
      to do this:
      <ol>
	<li> global variables: global variables are declared using the <tt>define</tt>
          function:
<pre>
(define a 10)
(define name "brad")
</pre>
        <li> local variables: local variables are introduced using the <tt>let</tt>
	  function:
<pre>
(let ((a 10)
      (b 7))
     (+ a b))   ; result is 17
</pre>
          <tt>let</tt> can be thought of as introducing a block with the
	  indicated bindings. The bindings are "live" within the let statement
	  and any nested let statements that do not override the binding.
	  <ol>
	    <li> syntax:
	  The initial argument to let is a list of bindings. The remaining
	  arguments are a list of expressions to be evaluated within that
	  let environment. The value of the let expression is the value of
	  the last expression in the let.
	    <li> order of evaluation in the binding list: The expressions
	      in the binding list are conceptually executed in parallel, and
	      hence bindings later in the list may not depend on bindings
	      earlier in the list. For example, the following is not allowed:
<pre>
(let ((a 10)
      (b (* a 5)))   ; illegal: b is not allowed to use the value of a
   ...)
</pre>
              because <tt>b</tt> depends on <tt>a</tt> having already been
              evaluated
	    <li> order of evaluation in the body: The statements in the
		body are executed sequentially. The last statement in the
		body is the value of the let expression. 
	        <p>
  	 	<ol>
		<li> one reason for having multiple statements in a let
			body is when you have side-effects, such as when
			using the display function.
<pre>
(let ()
  (display "The result is ")
  (display (+ 3 4))
  (newline)
)
</pre>
		</ol>
            <li> <tt>let*</tt>: If you want to force the bindings in the binding
	      list to be evaluated sequentially, with earlier bindings being
	      available to later bindings, then use <tt>let*</tt>:
<pre>
(let* ((a 10)
       (b (* a 5)))   ; b is 50
   (+ a b))          ; result is 60
</pre>
            </ol>
     </ol>
</ol>
<p>
<li> Conditionals, Relational Operators, and Boolean Operators
<p>
  <ol> 
    <li> Relational Operators:
      <ol>
	<li> For Numbers: Use =, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=  (but not !=, you
	  must say <tt>(not (= op1 op2))</tt> instead
        <li> For Strings: Use string=?, string&lt;?, string&lt;=?, etc. but
	  not string!=?
	<li id="comparison"> For anything else (although works with numbers and strings as
	  well)
	  <ol>
	    <li> (eq? operand1 operand2): shallow comparison using pointers
	    <li> (eqv? operand1 operand2): shallow comparison, but it will
	      return true if the elements have the same length and the same
	      value. For example, if both <tt>name1</tt> and <tt>name2</tt> have
	      the value "brad", then <tt>eq?</tt> will return false if 
	      <tt>name1</tt> and <tt>name2</tt> point to different copies of
	      "brad", but <tt>eqv?</tt> is required to return true (<b>our
		scheme interpreter does not seem to accept this definition
		of eqv? so I will not use it in this course</b>).
	    <li> (equal? operand1 operand2): deep recursive comparison of
	      two structures, such as two nested lists
	  </ol>
    </ol>
    <p>
    <li> Boolean Operators: <tt>and</tt>, <tt>or</tt>, and <tt>not</tt>
      are defined. You can use <tt>(not string=? ...)</tt> to test whether
      or not two strings are equal.
    <p>
    <li> Conditionals
      <ol>
	<li> Simple if-else:
<pre>
(if (&lt; a 0)
    0
    a)
</pre>
          The first argument is a boolean expression that should evaluate
          to a boolean value. The second and third arguments are the "then"
          and "else" expressions
        <p>
        <li> Compound if-else:
<pre>
(cond ((and (&lt; grade 100) (&gt;= grade 90)) "A")
      ((&gt; grade 80) "B")
      ((&gt; grade 70) "C")
      (else "B"))
</pre>
          <ol>
	    <li> The arguments to <tt>cond</tt> are pairs
	    <li> The pairs are considered in order from first to last
	    <li> The value of the <tt>cond</tt> is the value of the second 
	      element of the first pair in which the first element evaluates to
	      <tt>#t</tt>
	    <li> If none of the pairs evaluates to #t, then the value of the
	      <tt>cond</tt> is false
	    <li> You can use either <tt>else</tt> or <tt>#t</tt> as the
	      first element of the final pair to ensure that the final
	      pair provides a default value
	    <li> You can only provide a single expression for the second
	      argument to the pair--you may have to call a function to
	      get a more complicated computation or use <tt>let</tt>. 
	   </ol>
   </ol>
</ol>
<p>          
<li> Functions: Functions are constructed using the <tt>lambda</tt>
  constructor:
<pre>
(lambda (x) (* x x))   ; a function that computes x<sup>2</sup>
</pre>
  lambda creates an anonymous function object. For it to be useful you
  usually bind it to a name using either a <tt>define</tt> or a <tt>let</tt>
  statement. For example:
<pre>
(define x2 (lambda (x) (* x x)))
</pre>
  <p>
  <ol>
    <li> syntax: The first argument to lambda is a list of parameters. The
      remaining arguments constitute the body of the function. 
    <li> return value: The value produced by the 
      last expression executed in a function constitutes the return value
      of the function. Scheme does not have an explicit return statement so
      you have to organize your function so that a return statement is not
      required. That may mean breaking a large function into smaller functions.
    <li> parameter passing is by reference (the book calls it pass-by-sharing
      but it is close enough to pass by reference that we will call it such)
    <li> recursive functions: If you define a nested recursive function
      (i.e., one inside of a let statement), 
      you need to use a letrec (<u>let rec</u>ursion) 
      statement to define a recursive function, since a simple let statement
      does not allow a value to depend on a previous binding. Here is a
      simple factorial function:
<pre>
(letrec ((fact (lambda (n)
                 (if (or (= n 0) (= n 1)) 
                     1
                     (* n (fact (- n 1)))))))
   (fact 5)) ; result is 120
</pre>

  </ol>
