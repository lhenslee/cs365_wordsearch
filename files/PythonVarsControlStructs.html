<li> Python Overview
   <ol> 
   <li> What it's good for
       <ol>
	 <li> Most similar syntactically of the scripting languages to a conventional 
   programming language
	 <li> Works well in creating graphical user interfaces
	 <li> Works well as a convenient calculator
       </ol>
   <li> What it's not so good for: Also designed to work with shell-like 
     tasks, but I'd probably prefer Perl
   </ol>
<li> Invoking the Python Interpreter
   <ol>
   <li> Command-line interpreter: Type "python"-useful as a calculator and
     trying out snatches of code
   <li> Invoked with a file:
<pre>
python foo.py
</pre>
        <ol> 
	  <li> Argument Passing
	  <ol>
	    <li> arguments can be accessed via sys.argv
	    <li> import sys
	    <li> argv[0] contains the name of the file
          </ol>
        </ol>
   </ol>
<li> Comments
  <ol>
    <li> # starts a one-line comment
    <li> """...""" starts a multi-line comment: also used for documentation
      strings
  </ol>
<li> Python as a Calculator (or how it works with numbers)
  <ol>
    <li> Supports *, /, -, +, %
    <li> ** is exponentiation
    <li> / is integer arithmetic if both operands are integers, and
      floating point otherwise
    <li> float(x) converts a number to a float if you need floating point
      arithmetic and int(x) converts a number to an integer if you need
      integer arithmetic.
    <li> _ holds the last computed result, so you don't have to assign
      an expression to a variable
   </ol>
 <li> Strings: Treated like a primitive type
    <ol>
      <li> Types
	<ol>
	<li> Single quotes
	<li> Double quotes
        <li> Triple quotes--span multiple lines
	<li> Use \ to escape quotes
	<li> Use r'...' to include \'s in your strings: r stands for
	  "raw string"
      </ol>
      <li> String Operations
	<ol>
	  <li> Strings are immutable: assignment is really assignment of
	    a pointer
	  <li> + is concatenation
	  <li> Can use 0-based indexing to access individual chars
	  <li> Can use negative indexing starting at -1 to access chars
	    from the end of the string
	  <li> len(s): returns length of a string
	  <li> slicing allows you to get a substring
	    <ol>
	      <li> s[3:6]: string with characters 3 to 5, excludes 6
	      <li> s[:6]: start of string to character 5
	      <li> s[3:]: from character 3 to end of string
	      <li> s[-3:]: from 3rd to last character to end of string
	    </ol>
          <li id='stringsplit'> <tt>str.split([delimiter])</tt>: Splits a string into fields based
	    on the delimiter. The default delimiter is a space. Unlike some
	    other scripting languages, split treats consecutive delimiters
	    as a single delimiter. For example:
<pre>
>>> a = "3    5     8"
>>> a.split()
['3', '5', '8']
</pre>
            <tt>split</tt> is a nice way to break input lines into fields.
	  <li> <tt>str.strip()</tt>: returns a new string with the 
	    leading and trailing whitespace stripped away:
<pre>
>>> a = "brad vander zanden, yifan tang, george brett"
>>> names = a.split(',')
>>> names
['brad vander zanden', ' yifan tang', ' george brett']
>>> names[1].strip()
'yifan tang'
</pre>
          <li> Interpolation: not supported in Python. You must use a
	    string's <a href="PythonIO.html#format">format()</a> method
	    instead.
        </ol>
        <li> Converting values to strings
	  <ol>
	    <li> str(val): converts val to a human readable string
	    <li> repr(val): converts repr to a representation that
	      can be read by the Python interpreter
	    <li> Example:
<pre>
>>> x = 1
>>> s = 'the value of x is ' + x
TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects
>>> s = 'the value of x is ' + str(x)
>>> s
'the value of x is 1'
</pre>
            </ol>
	  </ol>
<li> Lists: A built-in data type
  <ol>
    <li> Syntax: a = [3, 4, 5, 6]
    <li> Individual elements can be accessed using array notation: a[2]
    <li> len(a): returns length of the list
    <li> a[1:3]: returns a sublist starting at index 1 and ending at index 2
    <li> lists are mutable
      <ol>
	<li> a[2] = 64: replaces the element at index location 2 with 64
	<li> a[1:3] = [4, 5, 6, 7]: replaces the slice 1:2 with the list 4,5,6,7
	<li> a.insert(3, 8): Inserts 8 at index position 3: Items starting at
	  position 3 are moved to the right
	<li> a.append(3): appends 3 to the end of the list
      </ol>
    <li> lists may be nested: [3, 4, [6, 7, 8], [9, 10], 3]--b[2][1] would
      return 7
    <li> lists are pointed to by pointers, although you cannot get access
      to the pointers
        <ol>
	  <li> when you use assignment, shallow copying is used, so modifying
	    a variable will cause all other variables pointing to the same
	    list to "change"
<pre>
a = [3, 4, 5]
b = a
b[2] = 8
a    // prints [3, 4, 8]
</pre>
        </ol>
     </ol>
<li> A Short Program
<pre>
a, b = 0, 1
while b < 10:
    print b
    a, b = b, a+b
</pre>
    Comments
     <ol>
      <li> You can use multiple assignment, and the right hand side is
	completely evaluated before the values are assigned to the left hand
	side--this makes things like swap much easier to perform
      <li> : terminates the condition in control constructs: () not needed
	around conditions
      <li> indentation rather than braces used to show grouping
	<ol> 
	  <li> shortens	programs
	  <li> avoids implied grouping errors in languages that use
	        braces 
	  <li> is controversial
        </ol>
      <li> print 
	<ol>
	  <li> prints a comma separated list of arguments with spaces between
	the arguments. 
	  <li> suppress a newline by ending the arguments with a comma
        </ol>
     </ol>
<li> Boolean operations
  <ol>
    <li> True/False: boolean constants
    <li> relational operators: use for both numbers and strings
    <li> boolean operators: all boolean operators are short-circuit
      operators
      <ol>
	<li> a and b: logical and
	<li> a or b: logical or
	<li> not a: logical not
      </ol>
    <li> conditions can be chained
<pre>
10 <= a <= 20    # true if a between 10 and 20
a < b == c       # true if a < b and b == c
</pre>
    <li> using lists to avoid multiple or's:
<pre>
if name in ['frank', 'george', 'ralph']: 
</pre>
is equivalent to
<pre>
if (name == 'frank') or (name == 'george') or (name == 'ralph'):
</pre>
</ol>
<p>
<li> if statement
  <ol>
    <li> syntax:
<pre>
if condition:
    statements
elif condition:
    statements
elif condition:
    statements
...
else:
    statements
</pre>
    <li> Must use <b>elif</b> rather than <b>else if</b>
    <li> Note that all control statements (if, elif, else) end with :
    <li> Python has no switch statement
    </ol>
<li> for loop
  <ol>
    <li> for loop iterates over a sequence:
<pre>
for var in sequence:
    statements that operate on var
</pre>
    For example, the following code sums the elements of a list:
<pre>
sum = 0
for value in data:
    sum = sum + value
</pre>
    <li> there is no equivalent of C's counting for loop
    <li> use the range command if you want a counting loop
      <ol>
	<li> range(x): returns a list of numbers from 0 to <tt>x-1</tt>. For example:
<pre>
range(4)  # yields [0, 1, 2, 3]
</pre>
        <li> range(x,y): returns a list of numbers from x to <tt>y-1</tt>
	<li> range(x,y,n): returns a list of numbers from x to <tt>y-1</tt>
	  incremented by <tt>n</tt> each time.
<pre>
range(0, 10, 3) # yields [0, 3, 6, 9]
range(10, 0, -3) # yields [10, 7, 4, 1]
</pre>
      </ol>
    <li> Example: to sum the numbers from 1 to 10:
<pre>
sum = 0
for i in range(1,11):
    sum = sum + i
</pre>
<p>
<li> how to iterate over different types of sequences
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li> enumerate(): gives you both the position index and value
<pre>
>>> for i, v in enumerate(['tic', 'tac', 'toe']):
...     print i, v
...
0 tic
1 tac
2 toe
</pre>
      <li> zip(): Allows you to loop over two or more sequences at the same
	time--pairs corresponding entries from each sequence. The following
	code computes the dot product of two vectors:
<pre>
>>> vector1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
>>> vector2 = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
>>> for v1, v2 in zip(vector1, vector2):
...   product = product + v1 * v2
... 
>>> product
2750
</pre>
      <li> reversed(): returns a iterable that iterates through a sequence
	in reverse:
<pre>
for v1 in reversed(vector1):
   print v1
</pre>
      <li> dictionaries:
	<ol>
	  <li> use <tt>dict.keys()</tt> to iterate through the keys
	  <li> use <tt>dict.iteritems()</tt> to iterate through the
	    key value pairs:
<pre>
>>> people = { 'brad': 45, 'yifan': 36, 'smiley' : 5 }
>>> for k, v in people.iteritems():
...     print k, v
... 
yifan 36
smiley 5
brad 45
</pre>
      </ol>
   </ol>
  <li> break, continue, and else on a loop
  <ol>
    <li> break: breaks out of the most enclosing loop
    <li> continue: continues with the next iteration of the loop
    <li> else on a loop: executes when the loop's condition becomes false,
      but not if the loop is terminated by a break statement. Here's an
      example that prints whether each number in a range is a prime number:
<pre>
for n in range(2, 10):
     for x in range(2, n):
         if n % x == 0:
             print n, 'equals', x, '*', n/x
             break
     else:
         # loop fell through without finding a factor
         print n, 'is a prime number'
</pre>
    </ol>
</ol>
<li> Functions
  <ol>
    <li> Syntax
<pre>
<b>def</b> functionName(args):
    """ Documentation String """ (<b>optional</b>)
    function body
    return value
</pre>
    <li> Native types are passed by value
    <li> Objects are passed by reference. If you modify the object, then
      you have modified the argument, because you accessed the object through
      the reference.
    <li> Variables are local by default. Python implements this by
      introducing a local symbol table for each function
      <ol>
	<li> Any time you assign a value to a variable, the variable is
	  written to the local symbol table
	<li> When you access a variable, Python first checks the local symbol
	  table. If the variable is not in the local symbol table, then Python
	  checks the global symbol table.
	<li> If you want to change a global variable, not a local variable,
	  then declare the variable as global at the beginning of the function
<pre>
def foo():
   global x
   ... statements that modify x ...
</pre>
     </ol>
    <li> The documentation string has a standard format that allows 
      documentation tools to automatically extract information about the
      function for documentation manuals
      <p>
	<ol>
	  <li> The first line should be a concise statement of the function's
	    purpose
	  <li> The second line should be blank, to create a visual separation
	  <li> The remaining lines should provide further documentation about
	    how the function is implemented, its side effects, its parameters,
	    etc.
	  <li> Here's an example:
<pre>
def dfs(x, y):
    """ Perform a depth first search starting at x and ending at y

        Parameters 
           x: The node from which to start the search
           y: The node at which to terminate the search

        Side-Effects: None
    """
    ...
</pre>
      </ol>
        <li> Variable-length argument lists: You can define variable length
	   argument lists but we won't use them in this class
	<li> Lambda functions: Lambda functions allow you to create anonymous
	   functions. For example, suppose you were implementing a spreadsheet
	   and wanted to make the input the user provides in a cell an
	   executable formula. You might write:
<pre>
def makeFormula(formula):
    return lambda: formula

newFormula = makeFormula("a + b")
</pre>
           Here's another example that creates an incrementer:
<pre>
def makeIncrementer(n):
    return lambda x: x + n

f = make_incrementor(42)
f(1)   # returns 43
</pre>
        <ol>
           <li> lambda functions must be a single expression that computes
	     a value
	   <li> cannot use conventional if-then-else. Instead use:
<pre>
lambda x,y: x if x < y else y
</pre>
           <li> can't use loops in lambda functions
       </ol>
       <p>
       <li> Generator Functions: You can create a function that incrementally
	 returns results using the <tt>yield</tt> statement. For example:
<pre>
>>> def fib():
...    yield 1
...    yield 1
...    current, prev = 1, 1
...    while True:
...      current, prev = current + prev, current
...      yield current
... 
>>> for i in fib():
...   if i > 100:
...     break
...   print i
... 
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
55
89
</pre>
          <ol>
	    <li> When you call a generator function, it creates and returns
	      a generator object. The generator object retains its state 
	      information between calls
	    <li> How to use a generator function
	      <p>
		<ol>
		  <li> In a loop as above
		  <li> Assign the generator object to a variable and then
		    call <tt>.next()</tt> each time you want the next value
<pre>
>>> a = fib()
>>> a.next()
1
>>> a.next()
1
>>> a.next()
2
>>> a.next()
3
>>> a.next()
5
</pre>
              </ol>
	    <li> You cannot easily use the yield statement in a recursive
	      function, because when you think you are calling the function
	      recursively, you are really creating a new generator function,
	      rather than calling the existing function. For example:
<pre>
def factorial(n):
   if n == 1:
      yield 1
   else
      yield n * fact(n-1)
</pre>
              This won't work like you think because you expect <tt>fact(n-1)</tt>
              to return a number, but it in fact returns a generator object
              and hence the multiplication fails with a type error. 
              <p>
	      There are sophisticated solutions beyond the scope of this 
	      course for doing recursive generator functions. An easier way
	      is to declare a nested function that returns a list of the
	      results, and then returns the results one at a time:
<pre>
def factorial(n):
   def fact(n):
      if n == 1:
         return [1]
      else:
         result = fact(n-1)
         result.append(n*result[-1])
	 return result
   results = fact(n)
   for i in results:
      yield i
</pre>
     </ol>
</ol>
<li> Coding Style: We won't cover it in class, but you should read the 
  generally accepted conventions for Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#intermezzo-coding-style">coding style</a>.
</ol>
